Islandora: Is native Drupal - With Islandora, you can create preservation-ready digital resources using Drupal nodes, media, files, and taxonomy terms. A suite of customized Drupal resource types and configurations that illustrate Islandora's capabilities are packaged as the Islandora Defaults module . Integrates with Fedora - Drupal resources can be stored in Duraspace's Fedora 5.x Repository as binary assets and RDF metadata. Uses microservices - Islandora provides an architecture for messaging and integration with any number of microservices, that provide services outside of the Drupal framework. Islandora's Crayfish suite of microservices provides functionality for synchronizing resources into Fedora and automatically generating derivative files. Can handle messages at scale - Islandora uses Alpaca , an integration middleware based on Apache Camel, to scalably handle messaging and queueing for microservices such as Crayfish. Offers digital preservation features - Using a robust storage layer for preservation (Fedora), and generating technical metadata with FITS, are digital preservation tools provided out of the box in the default implementation. Community members have created additional features for doing digital preservation using Islandora , which have not yet been contributed to \"Core Islandora\". Exposes data to harvesters - Metadata about resources is available as linked data through the JSON-LD serialization module , and can be made available through Drupal, Fedora, or a triplestore. Islandora also offers a full configuration for exposing OAI-PMH to metadata harvesters, and IIIF support for images. Offers flexibility - As Islandora content is Drupal content, migrations and batch editing can be done through Drupal's built-in migrate framework and controlled vocabularies created using Drupal taxonomies. Contributed Drupal modules such as Solr Search API enable in-site search, and Matomo Analytics provides usage metrics for site analytics. Is a community - A dedicated, active community of users and developers is working to push new features, collaborate on improvements, design custom solutions, and create extended functionality. Some of these for Islandora 8 take the form of Recipes . Try Islandora \u00b6 Online Sandbox \u00b6 Try Islandora without installing anything at http://future.islandora.ca/ . username: Test password: islandora Anyone can log in to this sandbox as an administrator (credentials are below and on the front page) and explore the interface! However, this site is refreshed periodically so your changes will not be permanent. This site uses Islandora Defaults, a way of setting up Islandora for demonstration purposes. This is not the only way that Islandora can be made to work! This sandbox includes, on top of Islandora Defaults, some sample content and configuration (such as views and blocks, and other Drupal modules like Views Bulk Edit) to increase its usefulness as a sandbox. Virtual Machine Image (.ova file) \u00b6 To try Islandora locally, you can download and run the latest community sandbox Virtual Machine image . This requires installing VirtualBox or another virtualization provider. This also uses Islandora Defaults, and similarly to the online sandbox includes sample content and other configured Views, Blocks, and Drupal modules. username: admin password: islandora Vagrant and Islandora Base Box \u00b6 The latest release of Islandora Defaults is uploaded as the Islandora 8 Base Box on Vagrant Cloud. If you have Vagrant and Git installed as well as VirtualBox, you can spin up the latest release of Islandora Defaults quickly by using the Islandora Playbook . On the dev branch, the Vagrantfile has the ISLANDORA_DISTRO variable default to 'islandora/8'. Like this, vagrant up will download the latest Islandora Base Box and will skip ansible provisioning. Same credentials as above, with further access to services documented in its README file. git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook cd islandora-playbook git checkout dev vagrant up Islandora Playbook via Ansible \u00b6 To use the Islandora Playbook as an Ansible Playbook, either set ISLANDORA_DISTRO to ubuntu/bionic64 or centos/7 (by editing the Vagrantfile or setting a shell variable), or, use Ansible to run it against an external linux server. Either way, be prepared to wait a while as Ansible installs Drupal via drupal-project and Composer. See Installation and Hacking on Islandora for more details. Join the Community \u00b6 The Islandora community is an active group of users, managers, librarians, documenters, and developers from GLAM (and beyond!) institutions worldwide.

Islandora recommends using Drupal's access control features. Contributed modules such as those described below, can provide additional flexibility and configurability. However, these only apply when content is accessed through Drupal, and are not applied to data in Fedora, the Triplestore, or Solr. Known strategies for implementing access control in Drupal include: Core Drupal Group Permissions by Term Field Permissions Exposed Endpoints If access control is a concern, you will want to lock down access to the following services that are part of the Islandora Suite: Fedora (REST API and admin client) Solr (API and admin client) Blazegraph (API and admin client) as anyone accessing data through those services are bypassing Drupal's access control. In all out-of-the-box sandboxes and demo instances, these services are wide open. Access Control in Core Drupal \u00b6 Summary: Core Drupal's access control features include the \"published\"/\"unpublished\" states and some basic permissions that can be granted globally or at the bundle level. Drupal's concepts of \"published\" and \"unpublished\" for nodes and media apply to Islandora just as they do in Drupal. Usually , published content is visible to the entire world (without any authentication), while unpublished content can only be accessed by selected users - usually administrators, other privileged roles, and the user who created the content. This is configurable through the Drupal Permissions interface. All Drupal permissions are granted to roles , not individual users. Read more documentation on Users . The extent of the configurability of Drupal Core's access control (excluding revisions) is provided by the following permissions: View permissions (apply to all content or all media regardless of bundle) - View all published content - View own unpublished content - View (published) media - View own unpublished media \"Editing\" permissions (can be granted for a specific bundle, or for all nodes or media): - Create new content - Edit (your) own content - Edit any(one's) content - Delete (your) own content - Delete any(one's) content Administrative permission (includes all the above and more, give to trusted users only): - Administer content These are the basic access control options built into Drupal Core. There are many contributed modules that do access control, some are described below. Before using access control modules, please see Comparison and Overview of Access Control modules on drupal.org. Contributed modules are required for the following cases: individual nodes or media having their own access policies (in Core Drupal, access can only be configured at the content type or media type level) access policies that grant privileges to users (in Core Drupal, access can be granted only to roles, and/or to that content's author) contents of specific \"management\" fields being reserved so that only privileged users can view or edit. Islandora Resources \u00b6 Given the [Collection] \u2192 Node \u2192 Media \u2192 File structure of Islandora resources, it is reasonable to wonder if access to a Node, Media, or File is influenced by the permissions on its \"parent\" resource. There is not yet a mechanism for Drupal's access control to be \"inherited\" from parent resources to child resources. An exception is non-public files, as described below. Sidebar: Access to files in Drupal \u00b6 Drupal's access control applies to files except those stored in Drupal's public filesystem . If you upload a file to Drupal, it's usually stored in a field on an entity. In Islandora, that entity is a Media. Drupal's access checks mean that a user must have permission to view the Media, and (if configured) the file field on that media, to see the file. However, file fields can be configured with various forms of file storage, and the file storage determines whether access control checks are applied at all. Files stored in Drupal's public filesystem are always public, viewable by anyone in the world. Drupal's access control applies to files accessed through Drupal where the file storage is: on Fedora using Flysystem on a Drupal private filesystem on another location such as S3 or Dropbox, through flysystem. Direct access to file storage Files stored using Flysystem are actually located on a separate service. It is the administrator's responsibility to implement appropriate access control on the target storage system , as there is a way to link directly to files in Fedora, S3, or Dropbox. These direct links bypass Drupal and therefore Drupal's access control. The filesystem used by a field is usually configured through \"Manage Fields\" on the appropriate entity. However, it is possible for a field to be configured to use a certain filesystem, but for actual files created through back-end processes to use a different one. For example, derivatives generated by Islandora in Islandora Defaults are written to the public filesystem, despite the field configuration which points to Fedora. To determine the actual location of a file, right-click the existing file in the Media Edit page and select \"copy location\". A file that is saved in flysystem will include /_flysystem/ in the URL. These links (you can test it!) only work if you have permission to view the media. A file with /sites/default/files/ is probably publically accessible (this is the public filesystem on most Drupal instances). In Defaults, All Derivatives Are Public Out of the box using Islandora Defaults, derivatives are created for all Islandora media (as long as the conditions of the contexts aree met), and they are stored in the public Drupal filesystem. This happens even if the media and/or node are not published. Access control in Solr \u00b6 The Search API Module, which connects Drupal to Solr, provides configuration so that access considerations are respected by the Drupal solr results display. The \"Processors\" configuration (e.g. at admin/config/search/search-api/index/default_solr_index/processors) provides checkboxes for the following options: \"Content access\": Adds content access checks for nodes and comments \"Entity status\": Exclude inactive users and unpublished entities (which have a \"Published\" state) from being indexed. Both are enabled out of the box in Islandora Defaults. This will ensure that queries through Drupal never show content that the active user shouldn't see, as well as preventing information about unpublished entities from ever being entered into Solr. Solr Admin Client Anyone with access to the Solr Admin Client may see the full contents of the index, regardless of permissions. In Islandora Defaults, the Solr client at http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/#/ISLANDORA is open to the world, and all published content (and user information) is accessible. Group (contributed module) \u00b6 \"The Group module allows you to create arbitrary collections of your content and users on your site and grant access control permissions on those collections.\" Opinion Group is one of the more hefty modules, and is difficult to learn. It is good if you have static or semi-static groups of users who need access to a static or semi-static group of content, but sharing an item with an arbitrary group of users is cumbersome. Permissions By Term (contributed module) \u00b6 \"The Permissions by Term module extends Drupal by functionality for restricting view and edit access to single nodes via taxonomy terms. [...] Taxonomy term permissions can be coupled to specific user accounts and/or user roles.\" By default, this module only affects nodes. To enable Permissions by Term for Media and other entities, enable the \"Permissions by Entity\" submodule. Islandora Defaults includes an empty vocabulary called \"Islandora Access\", which is intended to hold such taxonomy terms. However, permissions_by_term must be installed and configured on your own. This module is known to work, and appears to be supported well by the Drupal community. Warning This module is known in the Islandora community to cause performance degradation when large numbers of nodes are involved. Seth Shaw describes this in a blog post, Content Access Control Solutions Investigation . Examples Wanted Do you have experience setting up Permissions By Term? We'd love some illustrative examples here. Field Permissions (contributed module) \u00b6 \"The Field Permissions module allows site administrators to set field-level permissions to edit, view and create fields on any entity.\" Other contributed modules \u00b6 Workflow Participants allows for granting permissions on individual nodes or media to individual users, as an extension to the Workflow suite of modules. However, it is not well supported and the \"manage workflow participants\" permission should not be given to untrusted users as it may grant users the ability to add participants even to content they are otherwise not able to see or edit. Access control in Fedora \u00b6 In Fedora it is possible to control access to resources using Access Control Lists (ACLs) per the Fedora API Specification. ACLs are inherited through Fedora's LDP Containment relationships. Islandora does not create customized ACLs when syncing content into Fedora. Islandora does not create Fedora resources in hierarchies that use LDP containment relationships. At this time, access control in Fedora is NOT reflective of access control in Drupal. In the sandboxes and demo installations, all resources in Fedora are open for the world to view. This includes unpublished nodes and media, as well as the files uploaded into Fedora. Access controls configured in Drupal are not synced in any way to Fedora. Sites concerned with access control wish to \"lock down\" their Fedora to only be accessible through Drupal. Access control in the Triplestore \u00b6 In Islandora Defaults, there is no access control on the Blazegraph triplestore. Islandora defaults is configured so that all RDF triples sent to Fedora are also populated into the triplestore. If using the Ansible Playbook, it is available at http://localhost:8080/bigdata/. Like the solr index, it is open to the world by default. See Also \u00b6 Meta-Issue: Access Restrictions and Embargoes","title":"Access Control"},{"location":"concepts/access-control/#access-control-in-islandora","text":"This page is about controlling who can view or edit your Islandora content (metadata and binaries). Islandora recommends using Drupal's access control features. Contributed modules such as those described below, can provide additional flexibility and configurability. However, these only apply when content is accessed through Drupal, and are not applied to data in Fedora, the Triplestore, or Solr. Known strategies for implementing access control in Drupal include: Core Drupal Group Permissions by Term Field Permissions Exposed Endpoints If access control is a concern, you will want to lock down access to the following services that are part of the Islandora Suite: Fedora (REST API and admin client) Solr (API and admin client) Blazegraph (API and admin client) as anyone accessing data through those services are bypassing Drupal's access control. In all out-of-the-box sandboxes and demo instances, these services are wide open.","title":"Access Control in Islandora"},{"location":"concepts/access-control/#access-control-in-core-drupal","text":"Summary: Core Drupal's access control features include the \"published\"/\"unpublished\" states and some basic permissions that can be granted globally or at the bundle level. Drupal's concepts of \"published\" and \"unpublished\" for nodes and media apply to Islandora just as they do in Drupal. Usually , published content is visible to the entire world (without any authentication), while unpublished content can only be accessed by selected users - usually administrators, other privileged roles, and the user who created the content. This is configurable through the Drupal Permissions interface. All Drupal permissions are granted to roles , not individual users. Read more documentation on Users . The extent of the configurability of Drupal Core's access control (excluding revisions) is provided by the following permissions: View permissions (apply to all content or all media regardless of bundle) - View all published content - View own unpublished content - View (published) media - View own unpublished media \"Editing\" permissions (can be granted for a specific bundle, or for all nodes or media): - Create new content - Edit (your) own content - Edit any(one's) content - Delete (your) own content - Delete any(one's) content Administrative permission (includes all the above and more, give to trusted users only): - Administer content These are the basic access control options built into Drupal Core. There are many contributed modules that do access control, some are described below. Before using access control modules, please see Comparison and Overview of Access Control modules on drupal.org. Contributed modules are required for the following cases: individual nodes or media having their own access policies (in Core Drupal, access can only be configured at the content type or media type level) access policies that grant privileges to users (in Core Drupal, access can be granted only to roles, and/or to that content's author) contents of specific \"management\" fields being reserved so that only privileged users can view or edit.","title":"Access Control in Core Drupal"},{"location":"concepts/access-control/#islandora-resources","text":"Given the [Collection] \u2192 Node \u2192 Media \u2192 File structure of Islandora resources, it is reasonable to wonder if access to a Node, Media, or File is influenced by the permissions on its \"parent\" resource. There is not yet a mechanism for Drupal's access control to be \"inherited\" from parent resources to child resources. An exception is non-public files, as described below.","title":"Islandora Resources"},{"location":"concepts/access-control/#sidebar-access-to-files-in-drupal","text":"Drupal's access control applies to files except those stored in Drupal's public filesystem . If you upload a file to Drupal, it's usually stored in a field on an entity. In Islandora, that entity is a Media. Drupal's access checks mean that a user must have permission to view the Media, and (if configured) the file field on that media, to see the file. However, file fields can be configured with various forms of file storage, and the file storage determines whether access control checks are applied at all. Files stored in Drupal's public filesystem are always public, viewable by anyone in the world. Drupal's access control applies to files accessed through Drupal where the file storage is: on Fedora using Flysystem on a Drupal private filesystem on another location such as S3 or Dropbox, through flysystem. Direct access to file storage Files stored using Flysystem are actually located on a separate service. It is the administrator's responsibility to implement appropriate access control on the target storage system , as there is a way to link directly to files in Fedora, S3, or Dropbox. These direct links bypass Drupal and therefore Drupal's access control. The filesystem used by a field is usually configured through \"Manage Fields\" on the appropriate entity. However, it is possible for a field to be configured to use a certain filesystem, but for actual files created through back-end processes to use a different one. For example, derivatives generated by Islandora in Islandora Defaults are written to the public filesystem, despite the field configuration which points to Fedora. To determine the actual location of a file, right-click the existing file in the Media Edit page and select \"copy location\". A file that is saved in flysystem will include /_flysystem/ in the URL. These links (you can test it!) only work if you have permission to view the media. A file with /sites/default/files/ is probably publically accessible (this is the public filesystem on most Drupal instances). In Defaults, All Derivatives Are Public Out of the box using Islandora Defaults, derivatives are created for all Islandora media (as long as the conditions of the contexts aree met), and they are stored in the public Drupal filesystem. This happens even if the media and/or node are not published.","title":"Sidebar: Access to files in Drupal"},{"location":"concepts/access-control/#access-control-in-solr","text":"The Search API Module, which connects Drupal to Solr, provides configuration so that access considerations are respected by the Drupal solr results display.

Overview \u00b6 Choosing how we work together is an important privilege the Islandora community offers to its contributors. Our workflow is built around engagement and consensus to encourage high quality code that is expected to meet defined standards. All contributors are expected to follow the defined workflow. Any contributor can propose changes to the workflow at any time by initiating a conversation on the mailing list. Any proposed changes must be confirmed by the committers by way of an Apache rules vote in order to take effect. Social Dynamics \u00b6 We operate under the Islandora Community Code of Conduct . Some additional general observations to keep in mind when interacting with others in this workflow: We are all volunteers Time/attention of others is a limited resource. You cannot impose on others what to do. You should be motivated to do things by yourself. Common need is the driving force. Friendly cooperation is how its done Your contribution should not overstrain others. Your contribution is valuable when others appreciate it.

Play it safe and make a Github Issue Prioritizing pull requests: If there is an urgent need for the pull request to be addressed quickly, indicate the need in the pull request template or a comment. Complexity should also be taken into account when evaluating how quickly to merge a pull request. Changes that affect core modules or make extensive changes should receive more review and testing. All interested parties should be satisfied before something is merged; no hard numbers. If you know who is likely to be interested, tag them. Tag the creator of the issue if possible. Make a reasonable effort. If a pull request languishes without response when one is needed, tag @Islandora/8-x-committers (or @Islandora-Devops/committers if you\u2019re working on install code) with a reminder and/or put the issue on the agenda for the next Islandora 8 Tech Call All contributions to GitHub must be accompanied by either an Individual Contributor License or a Corporate Contributor License covering the contributor. Development Workflow: \u00b6 Create a Github Issue if none exists Assign the issue to yourself or request it to be assigned in a comment on the issue. Be sure to tag @Islandora/8-x-committers to bring attention to it. Perform development on a \u2018feature\u2019 branch. Give your branch a name that describes the issue or feature. Using something like \u2018issue-xxx\u2018 and including the issue number is always a safe bet if you don\u2019t know what to name it. When the code is ready for review, issue a pull request on Github from your feature branch into the development branch (\u20188.x-1.x\u2019 for Drupal modules and \u2018dev\u2019 for everything else) Continuous integration checks need to be satisfied before the code can be merged Coding standards checks and copy/paste mess detection must be passing before code can be merged. Automated tests are also expected to pass before code can be merged, however at times there can be extenuating circumstances preventing this. For example, sometimes there is a disconnect between running tests locally versus on the continuous integration server. If tests run locally and everyone involved in the pull request is in agreement, the check for automated tests can be ignored. But this isn\u2019t a common occurrence. Code coverage checks are more of a guideline than a strict requirement. A reasonable effort to provide tests for contributed code is expected. However, demanding 100% code coverage for all contributed code is unreasonable. If tests have been provided or updated and everyone involved in the pull request is in agreement, code coverage checks can be ignored. The code is reviewed and tested by the community, with all feedback and further development performed within the pull request. Once all feedback has been addressed, all applicable status checks have passed, and all interested parties are satisfied, the code can be merged by a committer Pull requests should not be merged by committers who have provided code in the pull request. Pull requests should also not be merged by committers who are peers in the same organization as those who provided code. Always \u201cSquash and Merge\u201d , please. Close the Github issue If you add the keyword \u201cfixes\u201d or \u201cresolves\u201d on the same line when referencing the Github Issue in the PR description, it will auto-close the issue when the PR is merged.

Submit documentation formatted in Markdown format. Include a top-level heading for the whole page (using # ) Please add Markdown headings ( # and ## ) to the content sections. Use the \"bold/emphasis\" style in Markdown by enclosing text in double asterisks or underscores, **bold text** or __bold text__ , for UI elements that users will interact with.

Use the \"italics\" style in Markdown by enclosing text in single asterisks or underscores, *italic text* or _italic text_ , for UI elements that have a label or title if you need to reference them in the documentation. For example, a title of a screen or page that will visit should be made italic in Markdown. Use >> and **bold text** to indicate clicking through nested menu items, and also include the direct path.

The documentation that you see here is formatted in the easy to use MarkDown markup language, which can add formatting such as links, headings, and bolded text. Then the documentation HTML site is built using mkdocs from the MarkDown files hosted in the Islandora documentation GitHub repo. This documentation is rebuilt automatically upon changes being committed to GitHub, so you will see changes reflected here within a few minutes of making an edit. The Islandora Documentation Interest Group holds regular meetings to discuss how to improve and expand Islandora's documentation. If you are interested in becoming involved, all are welcome to join. If you just want to make a contribution to the existing documentation, that process is outlined here. Before you start \u00b6 To edit documentation in Islandora, you must: have a GitHub account. NOTE: Github accounts are free and only require a valid email address. have a very basic familiarity with GitHub terms such as fork , branch , and pull request . be a member of the Islandora GitHub Organization . This is only needed if you want to commit changes directly to the documentation. Non-members may still make pull requests. To request an invite, email community@islandora.ca or ask on the Islandora Slack. have a basic familiarity with Markdown , or a good MarkDown cheat sheet . for example, you may use MarkDown syntax to create links and section headings. follow the Islandora Documentation Style Guide . have either an individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Islandora Foundation, or work for an organization that has a corporate Contributor License Agreement on file with the Islandora Foundation. for information on how to fill out and submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for yourself and/or your organization visit the License Agreements section of the \"How to contribute\" documentation page.

Make your changes directly in the browser editor, then scroll to the bottom to \"commit\" your changes. This is the equivalent of saving. If you are not a member of the Islandora GitHub organization, GitHub will create a new fork of the documentation repository in your GitHub account. From there you can make a pull request to have your changes sent back to the main Islandora documentation repo to be reviewed and accepted. If you are a member of the Islandora GitHub organization, you will be able to create a new temporary branch within the main Islandora documentation repo, and then create a pull request by selecting Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request . Give your branch a brief name starting with your username, with no spaces, indicating what it is for. Then click Commit changes . You will be taken to the pull request template which will prompt you to fill out some basic information about what you have changed, and why. Replace all relevant instances of Replace this text with your own text. You will have the option to tag Interested Parties , or people you would like to review your work, by writing in their GitHub account name after the @ symbol. If you don't have anyone specific in mind, you may tag @Islandora/8-x-committers to alert all Islandora 8 Committers that there is a new pull request for their review. When you have completed the template, submit your changes for review by clicking Create pull request . Once your pull request has been made, it will go into the pull request queue and anyone tagged in the request will receive a notification.

Whether running an installation using the provided Ansible playbook or installing the stack manually, it may be helpful to have a brief overview of all the components we're going to need, in the order we're going to install them, as well as a brief introduction to each component's installation and configuration process. This list includes four different kinds of components: Components which are hard-required (such as Drupal and the Islandora module) Components for which defaults are provided but which can be swapped out (such as the software managing databases, or the repository's storage system) Components that can't easily be swapped out but are not necessarily required (such as using Solr as the site's internal search engine) Components which do not have official alternatives and are not necessarily required, but will likely exist on the vast majority of Islandora 8 installations (such as Alpaca and Crayfish) The Webserver Stack - Apache, PHP, and MySQL/PostgreSQL \u00b6 Combined together, Apache, PHP, and MySQL/PostgreSQL comprise a LAMP or LAPP server used to provide end-user-facing components - namely, the website. Apache is the webserver that will serve up webpages to the public. It will also manage some internal funcionality provided by Crayfish, and will expose Cantaloupe to the public. We\u2019ll be making changes to the VirtualHost entry, enabling some modules, and modifying the ports configuration. The VirtualHost entry will eventually be modified when we need to expose other services like Cantaloupe to the public. PHP is the runtime interpreter for all the code Drupal and Crayfish need to be processed. By default, installing PHP 7.2 will give us a command-line interpreter, as well as an interpreter for Apache. We\u2019re going to install several PHP modules required and/or useful for the components that make use of PHP. MySQL and PostgreSQL are database management systems that we will use to store information for many different components like Drupal and Fedora. By default, the Ansible playbook installs MySQL, though this can be switched to PostgreSQL. The manual installation guide recommends and walks through installing and using PostgreSQL. The Front-Facing CDM - Composer, Drush, and Drupal \u00b6 Composer will be used to install both Drupal and Drush simultaneously using Islandora's fork of the drupal-project repository. Composer is an installer and dependency manager for PHP projects. We're going to need it to install components for any PHP code we need to make use of, including Drupal and Crayfish. Drush and Drupal are installed simultaneously using drupal-project . Drupal will serve up webpages and manage Islandora content, and Drush will help us get some things done from the command-line. The Web Application Server - Tomcat and Cantaloupe \u00b6 Several applets will be deployed via their .war files into Tomcat, including Fedora and Cantaloupe. Tomcat serves up webpages and other kinds of content much like Apache, but is specifically designed to deploy Java applications as opposed to running PHP code. Cantaloupe is an image tileserver that Islandora will connect to and use to serve up extremely large images in a way that doesn't have an adverse effect on the overall system. The Back-End File Management Repository - Fedora, Syn, and Blazegraph \u00b6 Fedora will be installed in its own section, rather than as part of the Tomcat installation, as the installation process is rather involved and requires some authorization pieces to be set up in order to connect them back to Drupal and other components. Fedora is the default backend repository that Islandora content will be synchronized with and stored in. A great deal of configuration will be required to get it up and running, including ensuring a database is created and accessible. Syn is the authorization piece that allows Fedora to connect to other components. Blazegraph will store representative graph data about the repository that can be queried using SPARQL. Some configuration will also be required to link it back to Fedora, as well as to ensure it is being properly indexed. The Search Engine - Solr and search_api_solr \u00b6 The installation of Solr itself is rather straightforward, but a configuration will have to be generated and applied from the Drupal side. Solr will be installed as a standalone application. Nothing of particular importance needs to happen here; the configuration will be applied when search_api_solr is installed. search_api_solr is the Drupal module that implements the Solr API for Drupal-side searches. After installing and configuring the module, the drush solr-gsc command will be used to generate Solr configs, and these configs will be moved to the Solr configuration location. The Asynchronous Background Services - Crayfish \u00b6 Crayfish is a series of microservices that perform different asynchronous tasks kicked off by Islandora. It contains a series of submodules that will be installed via Composer. Later, these configured components will be connected to Alpaca. The Broker Connecting Everything - Karaf and Alpaca \u00b6 Karaf \u2019s job is similar to Tomcat, except where Tomcat is a web-accessible endpoint for Java applets, Karaf is simply meant to be a container for system-level applets to communicate via its OSGI. Alpaca is one such applet; it will broker messages between Fedora and Drupal, and between Drupal and various derivative generation applications. Alpaca contains Karaf services to manage moving information between Islandora, Fedora, and Blazegraph as well as kicking off derivative services in Crayfish. These will be configured to broker between Drupal and Fedora using an ActiveMQ queue. Finalized Drupal Configurations \u00b6 Drupal configuration exists as a series of .yaml files that can either be created in a feature, or exported from Drupal using the content_sync module. It can also be manually entered in via the UI. We're going to place configuration in a few different ways; Some content will be synchronized onto the site, and some core configurations from the main Islandora module will need to be run in order to facilitate ingest.","title":"Component Overview"},{"location":"installation/component_overview/#component-overview","text":"A functioning Islandora 8 Stack is made up of dozens of components working in synchronization with each other to store information in your repository, manage that information, and disseminate it intelligently to users.

Within it, here is all the values you can set and their effects. This list is subjectively sorted in order of importance and usefulness. ENVIRONMENT \u00b6 Setting the ENVIRONMENT changes how your docker-compose.yml file gets constructed. When you switch from a demo to development to production environment, this is the variable to change. Available values for this setting are demo - For demo environments where you do not need access to the codebase local - For development environments where you need edit the codebase custom - For production environments where your codebase gets baked into a custom container By default, this is set to demo . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. DOMAIN \u00b6 What domain your Islandora site will be available at. If you are deploying anywhere other than your personal machine, you'll probably want to change this. By default, this is set to islandora.traefik.me . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. Changing this after installation has consequences If you are indexing RDF metadata in Fedora and/or a triplestore, please be aware of the implications of changing this once you have installed. By changing your domain, all of the subjects of your triples will be incorrect and you will have to reindex. There are make commands to streamline this proccess, but if you have lots of data it can potentially be costly in terms of time and effort. REPOSITORY \u00b6 Repository to use for pulling isle-buildkit images. By default, this is set to islandora . Change to local to use images you have built locally with isle-buildkit, or use your custom docker registry if you have set up one. If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. TAG \u00b6 The version of the isle-buildkit images to use. Non isle-buildkit images have their versions specified explicitly in their respective docker-compose files. By default, this is set to the latest stable release of isle-buildkit . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. USE_SECRETS \u00b6 Whether or not you want to use secrets. For demo and development environments, secrets are not required. They are essential if you are running a production environment, though. Secrets are contained in the secrets folder withiin your isle-dc installation. Each file represents an individual secret, and its contents are the value you're trying to protect. Available values for this setting are - true - false If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. DRUPAL_INSTALL_PROFILE \u00b6 Which install profile to use when making an initial installation. Valid values for this setting are the machine names of any Drupal profile. By default, this is set to standard . INSTALL_EXISTING_CONFIG \u00b6 Set this to true if you want to install an existing Drupal site whose configuration was exported with drush config:export Available values for this setting are - true - false By default, this is set to false . If you set this to true , be sure to set DRUPAL_INSTALL_PROFILE to minimal . INCLUDE_WATCHTOWER_SERVICE \u00b6 Whether or not to include Watchtower as a service. When developing isle-buildkit , this is extremely useful and will auto-deploy new containers as you make changes. You should not use watchtower on prodution environments, though. Available values for this setting are - true - false By default, this is set to true . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. INCLUDE_ETCD_SERVICE \u00b6 Whether or not to include etcd as a service. Available values for this setting are - true - false By default, this is set to false . If you don't know what etcd is, then leave this be. If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. INCLUDE_CODE_SERVER_SERVICE \u00b6 Whether or not to include the coder IDE as a service. If you're developing on Islandora, this can be pretty useful when developing. You should not deploy this service on production environments. Available values for this setting are - true - false By default, this is set to false . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. DRUPAL_DATABASE_SERVICE \u00b6 Which database engine to use for Drupal. Available values are - mariadb - postgres By default, this value is set to mariadb . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. Changing this after installation has consequences If you are changing from mariadb to potsrgres or vice versa, you MUST migrate your data yourself. ISLE will not convert your database from one to the other, and it's generally not advised to change this once you've installed. FCREPO_DATABASE_SERVICE \u00b6 Which database engine to use for Fedora. Available values are - mariadb - postgres By default, this value is set to mariadb . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. Changing this after installation has consequences If you are changing from mariadb to potsrgres or vice versa, you MUST migrate your data yourself. ISLE will not convert your database from one to the other, and it's generally not advised to change this once you've installed. COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT \u00b6 Sometimes when bringing up containers, you can encounter timeouts with an error like this: ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information. If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: XXX). By default, this value is set to 480, but if you have slow network conditions and encounter this error, consider bumping it higher. COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME \u00b6 Used for naming services in traefik as well as defining network alias and urls. For example the drupal service will be found at ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_drupal_1 . This is useful to change if you are running mulitple ISLE instances on one machine. By default, this value is set to isle-dc . If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD \u00b6 Allows building your custom image when setting ENVIRONMENT=custom By default, this is set to 1. You most likely will never have a need to change this. DOCKER_BUILDKIT \u00b6 Instructs Docker to use buildkit when building your custom image. By default, this is set to 1. You most likely will never have a need to change this. Trust us, you want buildkit. PROJECT_DRUPAL_DOCKERFILE \u00b6 The name of the Dockerfile to use after setting ENVIRONMENT=custom . By default, this is set to Dockerfile . You most likely will never have a need to change this. If you change this setting, you need to make -B docker-compose.yml to generate a new docker-compose.yml file that contains the changes you've made. DISABLE_SYN \u00b6 Set this to true to disable JWT authentication for Fedora. This is neccessary when performing a Fedora import using their import/export tools. By default, this is set to false . FEDORA_6 \u00b6 Whether or not to use Fedora 6. If you set this to false , you will be given Fedora 5. In general, unless you already have an existing site on Fedora 5, you'll want Fedora 6. By default, this is set to true .

If you follow these steps, you'll see how we can use our codebase folder to build a custom Drupal container, and bake code into the container instead of bind-mounting it in. We'll also cover how to store passwords as secrets and set up TLS. Getting Started \u00b6 If you haven't already made a local environment , you'll want to do that first. These instructions build off of having a codebase folder. Using your Domain \u00b6 At this point, we're assuming that you've purchased a domain to use for your repository. By default, islandora.traefik.me is used, which is fine for make demo and make local . But for your production site, you'll need to set the domain you own in your .env file. DOMAIN=example.org Secrets \u00b6 Sensitive information, such as passwords, should never be built into a container. It also shouldn't ever be bind-mounted in like we do with our codebase folder. If you use secrets, it's like bind-mounting in a file, except that file is provided from the host machine to the container using an encrypted channel. To use secrets, set the following in your .env file USE_SECRETS=true The secrets themselves are stored in the secrets folder of isle-dc . If you navigate to that directory, you'll see several small files, where each file represents a different password. By default, they are all set to password and you can change them to set your passwords for the system. TLS \u00b6 All public facing sites need to use HTTPS, and it's definitely a stumbling block for the uninitiated. Fortunately, isle-dc is set up to use HTTPS by default. Even when running make demo , your site runs over HTTPS at https://islandora.traefik.me . The default certificates are stored in the certs folder of isle-dc , and you can simply overwrite them with certificates from your certificate authority. As long as the certificates match the DOMAIN variable in your .env file, that is. File Purpose privkey.pem A PEM encoded private key used to sign your certificate cert.pem A PEM encoded certificate that also contains the issuer's certificate as well. Most certificate authorities offer \"Full Chain\" or \"With Issuer\" certificates that contain everything you need. Occassionally, you may find yourself needing to manually concatenate your certificate with the issuer certificate by hand. In that case, the certificate for your site goes first, and the issuer's certificate is appended afterwards. Using Let's Encrypt instead of Certificate Files \u00b6 Full support for Let's Encrypt is not available yet with ISLE, but will be soon. It can be done by hand though. Just understand that it takes editing your docker-compose.yml file, and those changes will be destroyed if you regenerate your docker-compose.yml file for any reason. Be sure to back up your docker-compose.yml file once you have things in place. The acme.json file \u00b6 Create an empty acme folder in isle-dc and bind mount it into Traefik. When Traefik start up, it will write acme.json to this folder. Your volumes section for traefik in your docker-compose.yml file should look like volumes: - ./certs:/etc/ssl/traefik:rw - ./tls.yml:/etc/traefik/tls.yml:rw - ./acme:/acme:rw Creating the certificate resolver \u00b6 Add the following to the commands section for traefik to tell it to use Let's Encrypt. --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpchallenge=true --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=http --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=your-mail@example.org --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/acme/acme.json --certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.caServer=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory Be sure to replace your-mail@example.org with the email address you've associated with Let's Encrypt. Adding the certificate resolver to routes \u00b6 For the Drupal, Matomo, and Cantaloupe services, you'll need to add labels to instruct Traefik to use the myresolver certificate resolver you just created. For example, for Drupal traefik.http.routers.isle-dc-drupal_https.tls.certresolver: myresolver Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you are still getting security exceptions, check what certificate is being used through your browser. Setting --log.level=DEBUG in the commands section for traefik will help out greatly when debugging. You can tail the logs with docker-compose logs -tf traefik If you aren't careful, you can hit Let's Encrypt's rate limit, and you'll be locked out for up to a week! If you want to use their staging server instead while testing things out, use --certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.caServer=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory You'll still get security exceptions when it's working, but you should be able to check the certificate from the browser and confirm you are getting it from the staging server.

Then set ENVIRONMENT=local If your site includes exported configuration from drush config:export , then you'll also need to set INSTALL_EXISTING_CONFIG=true DRUPAL_INSTALL_PROFILE=minimal Once you are ready, run make local to install the Drupal site in your codebase folder and spin up all the other containers with it.

It can be used both as a Vagrant project to create a local development environment, and/or as an Ansible playbook which can provision a remote server. Note This repository has two active branches. The main branch's playbook will install the latest release of Islandora and its components. The dev branch, when configured to use Ansible, will provision with the most recent code of Islandora and its components. Quick-start mode: \u00b6 The fastest way to spin up a local Vagrant version of Islandora Defaults is to use the Islandora Base Box, which is a packaged VM of the latest release of Islandora - including Islandora Defaults and all components. This is the default behaviour of the dev branch of the playbook. This method requires Vagrant and VirtualBox, but does not use Ansible. $ git clone -b dev https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook $ vagrant up This method results in an installation that does not contain the latest code changes. Requirements \u00b6 Download and install the following. VirtualBox and Vagrant are needed if creating local VMs. Ansible is only necessary if provisioning (not using quick-start mode described above): Virtual Box Vagrant (version 2.0 or higher required) Git OpenSSL Ansible (up to, and not past, 2.8.7) Installing Git, OpenSSL, and Ansible on Ubuntu/Debian \u00b6 Git and OpenSSL are available via apt . Ansible up to version 2.8.7. This is done best with pip , the python package manager: # Install git and openssl $ sudo apt-get install git $ sudo apt-get install openssl # If pip isn\u2019t already available, run the following commands to install it $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py $ python get-pip.py --user # Install ansible $ pip install --user -Iv ansible==2.8.7 Installing Git, OpenSSL and Ansible on CentOS \u00b6 Git and OpenSSL are available via yum . Most everything else can be installed in the same way. $ sudo yum install git $ sudo yum install openssl # If pip isn\u2019t already available, run the following commands to install it $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py $ python get-pip.py --user # Install ansible $ pip install --user -Iv ansible==2.8.7 Installing Git and Ansible on MacOS \u00b6 OpenSSL is already pre-installed on MacOS. Git can be installed using XCode's command line tools (see below). Python and Pip should be installed via the downloaded installer direct from the site (not shown below). For the installation of Ansible, consider using homebrew (see below). # Use xcode-select to install command line components, including git $ xcode-select --install # Install homebrew $ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" # Use homebrew to install ansible $ brew install ansible@2.8.7 Installing a local development environment \u00b6 Clone the islandora-playbook , set the base box, and use vagrant up to automatically provision a local environment. This method uses Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible. Before provisioning a local environment, you should likely double check that no required ports are currently in use. Clone the playbook \u00b6 For the most recent release: $ git clone -b main https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook For the bleeding edge: $ git clone -b dev https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook Set the base box \u00b6 To tell Vagrant which base box to use, set ISLANDORA_DISTRO. This can be done by editing the Vagrantfile or by setting a shell variable. Editing the Vagrantfile \u00b6 Open Vagrantfile (in the islandora-playbook directory) in a text editor, and find the following section. # Available boxes are 'islandora/8', ubuntu/bionic64' and 'centos/7' # Use 'ubuntu/bionic64' or 'centos/7' to build a dev environment from scratch. # Use 'islandora/8' if you just want to download a ready to run VM. $vagrantBox = ENV.fetch(\"ISLANDORA_DISTRO\", \"islandora/8\") To build a dev environment that is Ubuntu, change the last line of that section to: $vagrantBox = ENV.fetch(\"ISLANDORA_DISTRO\", \"ubuntu/bionic64\") To build a dev environment that is CentOS, change the last line of that section to: $vagrantBox = ENV.fetch(\"ISLANDORA_DISTRO\", \"centos/7\") Note that setting ISLANORA_DISTRO as a shell variable will override what is specified in the Vagrantfile. Setting ISLANDORA_DISTRO as a shell (environment) variable \u00b6 Or, an alternative to altering the Vagrantfile, you can set ISLANDORA_DISTRO by adding the following to .bashrc (on Ubuntu/Debian environments), or .bash_profile (on MacOS): export ISLANDORA_DISTRO=\"ubuntu/bionic64\" This will override what is written in the Vagrantfile. Spin up with Vagrant \u00b6 Before using vagrant up : If building a CentOS box, you also need to install the vbguest additions with vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest . If this is not your first time spinning up Islandora from this directory, and you want to get the latest code, you may want to clear cached ansible roles in roles/external rm -rf roles/external Then, to spin up the machine: vagrant up Installing a remote environment \u00b6 A remote environment can be provisioned by providing SSH credentials to claw-playbook and using the ansible-galaxy installer instead of Vagrant. Some preparation of configuration entries in the inventory also need to be changed to be aware of the particulars of your remote environment; this includes: Changing usernames and passwords to something more sensible than the default Changing IP addresses to use the remote machine's actual IP Changing Apache to serve at port 80 (as opposed to 8000, which we use for development purposes) We're going to build up this new remote environment configuration from the default provided Vagrant configuration. To start, take the inventory for the vagrant development environment and make a copy of it. Be sure to give it an appropriate name. Here we're using example . $ git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook $ cp -r inventory/vagrant inventory/example Then you can update the following entries in the following files using your own information. If an entry does not exist in a file, just add it. Ansible will then use the value you provide instead of relying on its defaults. We're using changeme to represent passwords and assume the server will be available at example.org , but you'll want to provide your own values. group_vars/all/passwords.yml \u00b6 drupal_db_password: changeme drupal_account_pass: changeme islandora_db_root_password: changeme islandora_tomcat_password: changeme islandora_syn_token: changeme cantaloupe_admin_password: changeme group_vars/crayfish.yml \u00b6 crayfish_gemini_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_houdini_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_hypercube_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_milliner_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_milliner_drupal_base_url: http://example.org crayfish_milliner_gemini_base_url: http://example.org/gemini crayfish_homarus_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_recast_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_recast_drupal_base_url: http://example.org crayfish_recast_gemini_base_url: http://example.org/gemini group_vars/karaf.yml \u00b6 For Alpaca, only the token.value and various URLs are of particular importance, but the entire configuration chunk is provided here for convenience. alpaca_settings: - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.http.client settings: token.value: changeme - pid: org.fcrepo.camel.indexing.triplestore settings: input.stream: activemq:topic:fedora triplestore.reindex.stream: activemq:queue:triplestore.reindex triplestore.baseUrl: http://example.org:8080/bigdata/namespace/islandora/sparql - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.triplestore settings: error.maxRedeliveries: 10 index.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-index delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-delete triplestore.baseUrl: http://example.org:8080/bigdata/namespace/islandora/sparql - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.fcrepo settings: error.maxRedeliveries: 5 node.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-content node.delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-delete media.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-media file.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file file.delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file-delete milliner.baseUrl: http://example.org/milliner/ gemini.baseUrl: http://example.org/gemini/ alpaca_blueprint_settings: - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.houdini in_stream: activemq:queue:islandora-connector-houdini derivative_service_url: http://example.org/houdini/convert error_max_redeliveries: 5 camel_context_id: IslandoraConnectorHoudini - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.homarus in_stream: activemq:queue:islandora-connector-homarus derivative_service_url: http://example.org/homarus/convert error_max_redeliveries: 5 camel_context_id: IslandoraConnectorHomarus group_vars/tomcat.yml \u00b6 fcrepo_allowed_external_content: - http://example.org/ cantaloupe_HttpResolver_BasicLookupStrategy_url_prefix: http://example.org/ group_vars/webserver/apache.yml \u00b6 This is where we specify that the webserver is listening on the default port 80, instead of the development machine port 8000. apache_listen_port: 80 group_vars/webserver/drupal.yml \u00b6 drupal_trusted_hosts: - ^localhost$ - example.org fedora_base_url: \"http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest/\" group_vars/webserver/general.yml \u00b6 openseadragon_iiiv_server: http://example.org:8080/cantaloupe/iiif/2 matomo_site_url: http://example.org hosts \u00b6 You'll need the SSH particulars for logging into your server in the hosts file.

See this page for more details about what you can put into a host file default ansible_host=example.org ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file='/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa' Running the remote installer \u00b6 First, you'll want to get the ansible roles that are needed for the version of Islandora you are trying to install. This can be done with $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml Then, depending on the operating system installed on the remote environment, you can use the following command for Ubuntu 16.04 $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbook.yml -e \"islandora_distro=ubuntu/xenial64\" or for CentOS 7 $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbook.yml -e \"islandora_distro=centos/7\" Troubleshooting \u00b6 Out of date playbooks \u00b6 Ansible caches the code used to provision the environment, so if you've already installed once you may not be getting the latest version of things even if you've git pull 'd the latest playbook. The code is stored in roles/external , so if you want to clear it out you can remove these before attempting to provision an environment $ rm -rf roles/external Port clashes for local environments \u00b6 When provisioning using a local environment, you should be aware of any ports that are already in use by your computer that are also going to be used by Vagrant, as these may clash and cause problems during and after provisioning. These include: 8000 (Apache) 8080 (Tomcat) 3306 (MySQL) 5432 (PostgreSQL) 8983 (Solr) 8161 (ActiveMQ) 8081 (API-X) If there are port clashes for any of these, you will need to either find and replace them in the configuration .yml files under inventory/vagrant/group_vars , or provide new values for the different playbooks that support changing the ports (for example, postgresql_databases supports adding a port property which is currently simply unused). You will also need to replace the port forwarding values in Vagrantfile . Additionally, Ansible attempts to use port 2200 for SSH. If this port is already in use, your local environment cannot be provisioned. To change this, set a new value for ansible_port in inventory/vagrant/hosts . Help \u00b6 If you run into any issues installing the environment, do not hesitate to email the mailing list to ask for help. If you think you've stumbled across a bug in the installer, please create an issue in the Islandora 8 issue queue and give it an ansible tag.","title":"Ansible Playbook"},{"location":"installation/playbook/#islandora-playbook","text":"The Islandora Playbook ( Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook ) is a tool for installing Islandora Defaults on a single virtual machine.

Also note that in all cases, http URLs are being used, as this guide does not deal with setting up https support. In a production installation, this should not be the case.

Each endpoint we need to be able to connect to will get its own .conf file, which we will then enable. Notice These configurations would potentially have collisions with Drupal routes, if any are created in Drupal with the same name. If this is a concern, it would likely be better to reserve a subdomain or another port specifically for Crayfish.

Adding a Fedora Configuration \u00b6 The Fedora configuration is going to come in a few different chunks that need to be in place before Fedora will be functional. We\u2019re going to place several files outright, with mildly modified parameters according to our configuration. The basics of these configuration files have been pulled largely from the templates in Islandora-Devops/ansible-role-fcrepo ; you may consider referencing the playbook\u2019s templates directory for more details. i8_namespaces.cnd is a list of namespaces used by Islandora 8 that may not necessarily be present in Fedora; we add them here to ensure we can use them in queries. /opt/fcrepo/config/i8_namespaces.cnd | tomcat:tomcat/644 <acl = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#'> <bf = 'http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/'> <cc = 'http://creativecommons.org/ns#'> <dcterms = 'http://purl.org/dc/terms/'> <dwc = 'http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/'> <exif = 'http://www.w3.org/2003/12/exif/ns#'> <fedoramodel = 'info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#'> <geo = 'http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#'> <gn = 'http://www.geonames.org/ontology#'> <iana = 'http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/'> <islandorarelsext = 'http://islandora.ca/ontology/relsext#'> <islandorarelsint = 'http://islandora.ca/ontology/relsint#'> <ldp = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#'> <nfo = 'http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo#'> <ore = 'http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/'> <owl = 'http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#'> <pcdm = 'http://pcdm.org/models#'> <pcdmfmt = 'http://pcdm.org/file-format-types#'> <pcdmrts = 'http://pcdm.org/rights#'> <pcdmuse = 'http://pcdm.org/use#'> <pcdmwrks = 'http://pcdm.org/works#'> <prov = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#'> <rdf = 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'> <rdfs = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#'> <rel = 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/'> <schema = 'http://schema.org/'> <skos = 'http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#'> <xml = 'http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace'> <xmlns = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/'> <xs = 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'> <xsi = 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'> We intend to have Crayfish installed later.

This may not be desirable, and if Crayfish is installed on a different port later, that change should be reflected here. The next part of the configuration defines where the pieces of the actual repository will live. Note that this file contains some of the defined FEDORA_DB variables from earlier. /opt/fcrepo/config/repository.json | tomcat:tomcat/644 { \"name\" : \"repo\", \"jndiName\" : \"\", \"workspaces\" : { \"predefined\" : [\"default\"], \"default\" : \"default\", \"allowCreation\" : true, \"cacheSize\" : 10000 }, \"storage\" : { \"persistence\": { \"type\" : \"db\", \"connectionUrl\": \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/FEDORA_DB\", \"driver\" : \"org.postgresql.Driver\", \"username\" : \"FEDORA_DB_USER\", \"password\" : \"FEDORA_DB_PASSWORD\" }, \"binaryStorage\" : { \"type\" : \"file\", \"directory\" : \"/opt/fcrepo/data/binaries\", \"minimumBinarySizeInBytes\" : 4096 } }, \"security\" : { \"anonymous\" : { \"roles\" : [\"readonly\",\"readwrite\",\"admin\"], \"useOnFailedLogin\" : false }, \"providers\" : [ { \"classname\" : \"org.fcrepo.auth.common.BypassSecurityServletAuthenticationProvider\" } ] }, \"garbageCollection\" : { \"threadPool\" : \"modeshape-gc\", \"initialTime\" : \"00:00\", \"intervalInHours\" : 24 }, \"node-types\" : [\"fedora-node-types.cnd\", \"file:/opt/fcrepo/config/i8_namespaces.cnd\"] } Finally, we need an actual fcrepo-config.xml to pull this configuration into place. There's nothing to edit in here by default, but pay attention to the p:repositoryConfiguration property of the modeshapeRepofactory bean, which contains the path to the repository.json file we made earlier.

need our Tomcat JAVA_OPTS to include references to our repository configuration. /opt/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh Before : 3 | export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dcantaloupe.config=/opt/cantaloupe_config/cantaloupe.properties -server -Xmx1500m -Xms1000m\" After : 3 | export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true

-Dfcrepo.spring.configuration=file:///opt/fcrepo/config/fcrepo-config.xml -server -Xmx1500m -Xms1000m\" Ensuring Tomcat Users Are In Place \u00b6 While not strictly necessary, we can use the tomcat-users.xml file to give us direct access to the Fedora endpoint. Fedora defines, out of the box, a fedoraAdmin and fedoraUser role that can be reflected in the users list for access. The following file will also include the base tomcat user. As always, these default passwords should likely not stay as the defaults. /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml | tomcat:tomcat/600 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <tomcat-users xmlns=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/xml\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd\" version=\"1.0\"> <role rolename=\"tomcat\"/> <role rolename=\"fedoraAdmin\"/> <role rolename=\"fedoraUser\"/> <user username=\"tomcat\" password=\"TOMCAT_PASSWORD\" roles=\"tomcat\"/> <user username=\"fedoraAdmin\" password=\"FEDORA_ADMIN_PASSWORD\" roles=\"fedoraAdmin\"/> <user username=\"fedoraUser\" password=\"FEDORA_USER_PASSWORD\" roles=\"fedoraUser\"/> </tomcat-users> TOMCAT_PASSWORD : tomcat FEDORA_ADMIN_PASSWORD : islandora FEDORA_USER_PASSWORD : islandora Downloading and Placing the Latest Release \u00b6 Fedora .war files are packaged up as releases on the official GitHub repository; you can find the latest version at the releases page; the official GitHub repository is labelled as fcrepo4 but does actually contain more recent versions than 4. You should download the most recent stable release. sudo wget -O fcrepo.war FCREPO_WAR_URL sudo mv fcrepo.war /opt/tomcat/webapps sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps/fcrepo.war FCREPO_WAR_URL : This can be found at the fcrepo downloads page ; the file you're looking for is: Tagged in green as the 'Latest release' The .war version of the file Restarting the Tomcat Service \u00b6 As before, restart the Tomcat service to get Fedora up and running. sudo systemctl restart tomcat Syn \u00b6 Downloading the Syn JAR File \u00b6 A compiled JAR of Syn can be found on the Syn releases page . We\u2019re going to add this to the list libraries accessible to Tomcat. sudo wget -P /opt/tomcat/lib SYN_JAR_URL # Ensure the library has the correct permissions. sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/lib sudo chmod -R 640 /opt/tomcat/lib SYN_JAR_URL : The latest stable release of the Syn JAR from the releases page . Specifically, the JAR compiled as -all.jar is required. Generating an SSL Key for Syn \u00b6 For Islandora and Fedora to talk to each other, an SSL key needs to be generated for use with Syn. We\u2019re going to make a spot where such keys can live, and generate one. sudo mkdir /opt/keys sudo openssl genrsa -out \"/opt/keys/syn_private.key\" 2048 sudo openssl rsa -pubout -in \"/opt/keys/syn_private.key\" -out \"/opt/keys/syn_public.key\" sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/keys/syn* Placing the Syn Settings \u00b6 Syn sites and tokens belong in a settings file that we\u2019re going to reference in Tomcat. /opt/fcrepo/config/syn-settings.xml | tomcat:tomcat/600 <config version='1' header='X-Islandora'> <site algorithm='RS256' encoding='PEM' anonymous='true' default='true' path='/opt/keys/syn_public.key'/> <token user='islandora' roles='fedoraAdmin'>ISLANDORA_SYN_TOKEN</token> </config> ISLANDORA_SYN_TOKEN : islandora This should be a secure generated token rather than this default; it will be configured on the Drupal side later. Adding the Syn Valve to Tomcat \u00b6 Referencing the valve we\u2019ve created in our syn-settings.xml involves creating a <Valve> entry in Tomcat\u2019s context.xml : /opt/tomcat/conf/context.xml Before : 29 | --> 30 | </Context> After : 29 | --> 30 | <Valve className=\"ca.islandora.syn.valve.SynValve\" pathname=\"/opt/fcrepo/config/syn-settings.xml\"/> 31 | </Context> Restarting Tomcat \u00b6 Finally, restart tomcat to apply the new configurations. sudo systemctl restart tomcat Blazegraph 2 \u00b6 Creating a Working Space for Blazegraph \u00b6 Blazegraph needs a space for configurations and data; we\u2019re going to create this space in /opt . sudo mkdir -p /opt/blazegraph/data sudo mkdir /opt/blazegraph/conf sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/blazegraph Downloading and Placing the Blazegraph WAR \u00b6 The Blazegraph .war file can be found in a few different places, but to ensure we\u2019re able to easily wget it, we\u2019re going to use the maven.org repository link to grab it. cd /opt sudo wget -O blazegraph.war BLAZEGRAPH_WARFILE_LINK sudo mv blazegraph.war /opt/tomcat/webapps sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps/blazegraph.war BLAZEGRAPH_WAR_URL: You can find a link to this at the Maven repository for Blazegraph ; you\u2019ll want to click the link for the latest version of Blazegraph 2.1.x, then get the link to the .war file within that version folder. Once this is downloaded, give it a moment to expand before moving on to the next step. Configuring Logging \u00b6 We would like to have an appropriate logging configuration for Blazegraph, which can be useful for looking at incoming traffic and determining if anything has gone wrong with Blazegraph. Our logger isn\u2019t going to be much different than the default logger; it can be made more or less verbose by changing the default WARN levels.

KARAF_DIRECTORY : This will depend on the exact version being used, but will likely be /opt/apache-karaf-VERSION , where VERSION is the current Karaf version number. Configuring Karaf Logging \u00b6 We\u2019re going to apply some basic logging to our Karaf installation that should suffice for an example.

For now, this will simply be the path to JAVA_HOME , but this also accepts many other parameters you can find in the default setenv script. /opt/karaf/bin/setenv | karaf:karaf/755 #!/bin/sh export JAVA_HOME=\"PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME\" PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME : This will be the same JAVA_HOME we used when installing Tomcat , and can be found using the same method (i.e., still /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 if that's what it was before). Initializing Karaf \u00b6 We\u2019re going to start Karaf, then run the installer to put our configurations in place and generate a Karaf service. Once these are installed, we\u2019re going to stop Karaf, as from there on out its start/stop management should be handled via that service. sudo -u karaf /opt/karaf/bin/start # You may want to wait a bit for Karaf to start. # If you're not sure whether or not it's running, you can always run: # ps aux | grep karaf # to see if the server is up and running. /opt/karaf/bin/client feature:install wrapper /opt/karaf/bin/client wrapper:install /opt/karaf/bin/stop Creating and Starting the Karaf Service \u00b6 Installing the Karaf wrapper generates several service files that can be used on different types of systems. For this example installation on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine, we want to enable the karaf.service service so that Karaf is properly started on boot. sudo systemctl enable /opt/karaf/bin/karaf.service sudo systemctl start karaf Alpaca 1.0.x \u00b6 Adding the Required Karaf Repositories \u00b6 Karaf features can be installed from several different types of sources, but the fastest and easiest way to do so is from existing repository URLs that we can just plug into Karaf to provide us feature lists prepared and ready for installation. Like most interactions with Karaf, we can add these repositories using its built-in client . Notice These repositories are updated consistently, and their updates include revised dependency lists. Commonly, when repositories are out of date or otherwise mismatched, feature installation can result in an Unable to resolve root: missing requirement error; for this reason, this guide recommends using recently-updated versions of these repositories. That being said, if such errors occur despite installing the latest versions of these features, the maintainer of the features repository should be informed. For the Karaf features we\u2019re going to install, we need a few different repositories to be added to the list: /opt/karaf/bin/client repo-add mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/ACTIVEMQ_KARAF_VERSION/xml/features /opt/karaf/bin/client repo-add mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/APACHE_CAMEL_VERSION/xml/features /opt/karaf/bin/client repo-add mvn:ca.islandora.alpaca/islandora-karaf/LATEST/xml/features # XXX: This shouldn't be strictly necessary, but appears to be a missing # upstream dependency for some fcrepo features. /opt/karaf/bin/client repo-add mvn:org.apache.jena/jena-osgi-features/JENA_OSGI_VERSION/xml/features ACTIVEMQ_KARAF_VERSION : The latest version of ActiveMQ Karaf 5.x.x; you can find this listed at the activemq-karaf repository page (e.g., 5.15.11 at the time of writing) APACHE_CAMEL_VERSION : The latest version of Apache Camel 2.x.x; you can find this listed at the apache-camel repository page (e.g., 2.25.0 at the time of writing) JENA_OSGI_VERSION : The latest version of the Apache Jena OSGi features; you can find this listed at the jena-osgi-features repository page (e.g., 3.14.0 at the time of writing) Configuring Karaf Features \u00b6 Our installed Karaf features require configuration files to know exactly where to route things coming and going from them. /opt/karaf/etc/ca.islandora.alpaca.http.client.cfg | karaf:karaf/644 token.value=ISLANDORA_SYN_TOKEN ISLANDORA_SYN_TOKEN : This should be the same token that was established during the installation of Syn in your syn-settings.xml file /opt/karaf/etc/org.fcrepo.camel.indexing.triplestore.cfg | karaf:karaf/644 input.stream=activemq:topic:fedora triplestore.reindex.stream=activemq:queue:triplestore.reindex triplestore.baseUrl=http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/namespace/islandora/sparql /opt/karaf/etc/ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.triplestore.cfg | karaf:karaf/644 error.maxRedeliveries=10 index.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-index delete.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-delete triplestore.baseUrl=http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/namespace/islandora/sparql /opt/karaf/etc/ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.fcrepo.cfg | karaf:karaf/644 error.maxRedeliveries=5 node.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-content node.delete.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-delete media.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-media file.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file file.delete.stream=activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file-delete milliner.baseUrl=http://localhost/milliner gemini.baseUrl=http://localhost/gemini Blueprinting Karaf Derivative Connectors \u00b6 For those services in Crayfish we have set up to provide derivatives to Islandora resources, we need connector blueprints to tell the derivative connector how to route incoming requests, run conversions, and return outgoing derivatives. Our blueprints are going to look largely similar between services, with only a few properties changing between them. Largely, these mainly just need to match the ActiveMQ queues we established in the previous configuration, and route to the correct Crayfish service.

On a production installation, this may vary, especially if parts of the installation live on different severs Solr port should be set to the port Solr was installed on, which is 8983 by default Solr path should be set to the configured path to the instance of Solr; in a default installation, there is only one Solr instance, and it lives at / Solr core should be the name of the Solr core you created earlier, which is why it's listed as SOLR_CORE here Under ADVANCED SERVER CONFIGURATION , solr.install.dir should be set to the path where we installed Solr, which this guide has established at /opt/solr Click Save to create the server configuration.

Navigate to /admin/config/search/search-api/add-index and check off the things you'd like to be indexed. Notice You should come back here later and reconfigure this after completing the last step in this guide. The default indexing configuration is pretty permissive, and you may want to restrict, for example, indexed content to just Islandora-centric bundles.

On a production installation, Solr should likely be installed behind an HTTPS connection. Solr host can be set to localhost since, again, this is set up on the same machine Drupal lives on. On a production installation, this may vary, especially if parts of the installation live on different severs Solr port should be set to the port Solr was installed on, which is 8983 by default Solr path should be set to the configured path to the instance of Solr; in a default installation, there is only one Solr instance, and it lives at / Solr core should be the name of the Solr core you created earlier, which is why it's listed as SOLR_CORE here Under ADVANCED SERVER CONFIGURATION , solr.install.dir should be set to the path where we installed Solr, which this guide has established at /opt/solr Click Save to create the server configuration. Notice You can ignore the error about an incompatible Solr schema; we're going to set this up in the next step. In fact, if you refresh the page after restarting Solr in the next step, you should see the error disappear.","title":"Configuring search_api_solr"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_solr/#generating-and-applying-solr-configurations","text":"Now that our core is in place and our Drupal-side configurations exist, we\u2019re ready to generate Solr configuration files to connect this site to our search engine. cd /opt/drupal drush solr-gsc SERVER_MACHINE_NAME /opt/drupal/solrconfig.zip unzip -d ~/solrconfig solrconfig.zip sudo cp ~/solrconfig/* /var/solr/data/SOLR_CORE/conf sudo systemctl restart solr SERVER_MACHINE_NAME : This should be the machine_name that was automatically generated when creating the configuration in the above step.","title":"Generating and Applying Solr Configurations"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_solr/#adding-an-index","text":"In order for content to be indexed back into Solr, a search index needs to be added to our server.

In our case, OpenJDK 8 is open-source, free to use, and can fairly simply be installed using apt-get : sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre The installation of OpenJDK via apt-get establishes it as the de-facto Java runtime environment to be used on the system, so no further configuration is required. The resultant location of the java JRE binary (and therefore, the correct value of JAVA_HOME when it\u2019s referenced) will vary based on the specifics of the machine it\u2019s being installed on; that being said, you can find its exact location using update-alternatives : update-alternatives --list java Creating a tomcat User \u00b6 Apache Tomcat, and all its processes, will be owned and managed by a specific user for the purposes of keeping parts of the stack segregated and accountable. sudo addgroup tomcat sudo adduser tomcat --ingroup tomcat --home /opt/tomcat --shell /usr/bin You will be prompted to create a password for the tomcat user; all the other information as part of the adduser command can be ignored. Downloading and Placing Tomcat 8 \u00b6 Tomcat 8 itself can be installed in several different ways; while it\u2019s possible to install via apt-get , this doesn\u2019t give us a great deal of control over exactly how we\u2019re going to run and manage it; as a critical part of the stack, it is beneficial for our purposes to have a good frame of reference for the inner workings of Tomcat. We\u2019re going to download the latest version of Tomcat to /opt and set it up so that it runs automatically. Bear in mind that with the following commands, this is going to be entirely relative to the current version of Tomcat 8, which we\u2019ll try to mitigate as we go. cd /opt sudo wget -O tomcat.tar.gz TOMCAT_TARBALL_LINK sudo tar -zxvf tomcat.tar.gz sudo mv /opt/TOMCAT_DIRECTORY/* /opt/tomcat sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat TOMCAT_TARBALL_LINK : No default can be provided here; you should navigate to the Tomcat 8 downloads page and grab the link to the latest .tar.gz file under the \u201cCore\u201d section of \u201cBinary Distributions\u201d. It is highly recommended to grab the latest version of Tomcat 8, as it will come with associated security patches and fixes. TOMCAT_DIRECTORY : This will also depend entirely on the exact version of tomcat downloaded - for example, apache-tomcat-8.5.47 . Again, ls /opt can be used to find this. Creating a setenv.sh Script \u00b6 When Tomcat runs, some configuration needs to be pre-established as a series of environment variables that will be used by the script that runs it. /opt/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh | tomcat:tomcat/755 export CATALINA_HOME=\"/opt/tomcat\" export JAVA_HOME=\"PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME\" export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -server -Xmx1500m -Xms1000m\" PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME : This will vary a bit depending on the environment, but will likely live in /usr/lib/jvm somewhere (e.g., /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 for an installation on a machine with an AMD processor); again, in an Ubunutu environment you can check a part of this using update-alternatives --list java , which will give you the path to the JRE binary within the Java home Creating the Tomcat Service \u00b6 Tomcat includes two shell scripts we\u2019re going to make use of - startup.sh and shutdown.sh - which are light wrappers on top of a third script, catalina.sh , which manages spinning up and shutting down the Tomcat server. Ubuntu 18.04 uses systemctl to manage services; we\u2019re going to create a .service file that can run these shell scripts. /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service | root:root/755 [Unit] Description=Tomcat [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh ExecStop=/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh SyslogIdentifier=tomcat [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Enabling and Starting Tomcat \u00b6 We\u2019re going to both enable and start Tomcat. Enabling Tomcat will ensure that it starts on boot, the timing of which is defined by the [Install] section\u2019s WantedBy statement, which specifies what it should start after. This is separate from starting it, which we need to do now in order to get Tomcat up and running without requiring a reboot. sudo systemctl enable tomcat sudo systemctl start tomcat We can check that Tomcat has started by running systemctl status tomcat | grep Active ; we should see that Tomcat is active (running) , which is the correct result of startup.sh finishing its run successfully. Installing Cantaloupe 4 \u00b6 Stopping the Tomcat service \u00b6 Before we start working with Cantaloupe, we should stop Tomcat; otherwise, Cantaloupe will automatically be deployed from its .war file, and we\u2019d like everything to be in place before the deployment. sudo systemctl stop tomcat Downloading and Placing the Cantaloupe WAR \u00b6 Releases of Cantaloupe live on the Cantaloupe release page ; the latest version can be found here as a .zip file. sudo wget -O /opt/cantaloupe.zip CANTALOUPE_RELEASE_URL sudo unzip /opt/cantaloupe.zip sudo cp CANTALOUPE_DIR/CANTALOUPE_WAR /opt/tomcat/webapps/cantaloupe.war sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps/cantaloupe.war CANTALOUPE_RELEASE_URL : It\u2019s recommended we grab the latest version of Cantaloupe 4. This can be found on the above-linked release page, as the .zip version; for example, https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/cantaloupe/releases/download/v4.1.4/cantaloupe-4.1.4.zip CANTALOUPE_DIR : This will depend on the exact version of Cantaloupe downloaded; in the above example release, this would be cantaloupe-4.1.4 CANTALOUPE_WAR : This will also depend on the exact version of Cantaloupe downloaded; in the above example release, this would be cantaloupe-4.1.4.war Creating a Cantaloupe Configuration \u00b6 Cantaloupe pulls its configuration from a file called cantaloupe.properties ; there are also some other files that can contain instructions for Cantaloupe while it\u2019s running; specifically, we\u2019re going to copy over the delegates.rb file, which can also contain custom configuration. We won\u2019t make use of this file; we\u2019re just copying it over for demonstration purposes. Creating these files from scratch is not recommended; rather, we\u2019re going to take the default cantaloupe configurations and plop them into their own folder so we can work with them. sudo mkdir /opt/cantaloupe_config sudo cp CANTALOUPE_DIR/cantaloupe.properties.sample /opt/cantaloupe_config/cantaloupe.properties sudo cp CANTALOUPE_DIR/delegates.rb.sample /opt/cantaloupe_config/delegates.rb The out-of-the-box configuration will work fine for our purposes, but it\u2019s highly recommended that you take a look through the cantaloupe.properties and see what changes can be made; specifically, logging to actual logfiles isn\u2019t set up by default, so you may want to take a peek at the log.application.SyslogAppender or log.application.RollingFileAppender , as well as changing the logging level. Defining the Cantaloupe Configuration Location \u00b6 Now that we have a Cantaloupe configuration, we need to make a change to Tomcat\u2019s JAVA_OPTS so that its location can be referenced when Tomcat spins it up. This will involve changing the setenv.sh created when setting up Tomcat. /opt/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh Before : 3 | export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -server -Xmx1500m -Xms1000m\" After : 3 | export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dcantaloupe.config=/opt/cantaloupe_config/cantaloupe.properties -server -Xmx1500m -Xms1000m\" Starting the Tomcat Service \u00b6 After Cantaloupe has been completely provisioned, we\u2019re ready to switch Tomcat back on so that Cantaloupe automatically deploys with the established configuration. sudo systemctl start tomcat","title":"Installing Tomcat and Cantaloupe"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_tomcat_and_cantaloupe/#installing-tomcat-and-cantaloupe","text":"","title":"Installing Tomcat and Cantaloupe"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_tomcat_and_cantaloupe/#in-this-section-we-will-install","text":"Tomcat 8 , the Java servlet container that will serve up some Java applications on various endpoints, including, importantly, Fedora Cantaloupe 4 , the image tileserver - running in Tomcat - that will be used to serve up large images in a web-accessible fashion","title":"In this section, we will install:"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_tomcat_and_cantaloupe/#tomcat-8","text":"","title":"Tomcat 8"},{"location":"installation/manual/installing_tomcat_and_cantaloupe/#installing-openjdk-8","text":"Tomcat runs in a Java runtime environment, so we'll need one to continue.

The server created using this guide is not hardened, will not be easily scalable, and the components may not be configured in a way you consider easy to work with. A production instance of Islandora 8 should be installed and maintained by a professional with an understanding of Linux and server administration. This guide will contain generalized steps on installation and configuration of the various components, but will contain specific example commands for executing these steps on an Ubuntu 18.04 Server. Some Prerequisite Knowledge \u00b6 This guide assumes the user has some knowledge: A general idea of how to work on the command-line of a Linux server using Bash. Commands are described in detail, but servers are volatile, and knowledge is still assumed in case anything happens outside of your expectations. An understanding of how to modify files from the command line. Configurations will often need to be created or modified in order to get things up and running. This might involve using an application like nano or vi / vim , or creating these files locally and uploading them to the server. It should also generally be assumed that most of these configuration files will have to be created or edited using sudo , and that permissions and ownership may need to be specified on these files. Conventions Used in This Guide \u00b6 Chronological Organization \u00b6 The steps in this guide are listed in chronological order of installation and configuration. Some sections will reference variables and rely on components installed in previous sections. It does not account for skipping over or otherwise changing the order of installation steps; bear this in mind if you decide to do things out of the provided order. Replacement Variables \u00b6 It is expected that the person setting up the site may want to use different usernames, passwords, and other such variables than the ones presented by default in this guide. Additionally, some defaults can't be provided, such as up-to-date version information for externally-provided components. In such cases, the replacement variables will be placed in all capital letters, and a description of the variables, any possible defaults, and how to get up-to-date information, will be listed below. Bash Commands \u00b6 Notice Command blocks are always assumed to start at the home folder of the user originally created during the server installation. They are never run as root ; if root access is required, sudo will be specified, and if files are created belonging to root that should not belong to root , chmod and chown will be run against them immediately afterwards to ensure correct permissions. If commands need to be run from a different working directory, an absolute path will be specified to use with cd . If you're concerned about whether or not a code block can be run from your current working directory, run cd ~ before executing any commands in it. Commands to be run on the command line will be placed in code blocks, with one command per line, and any replacement variables below, e.g., sudo run --this-command python3 run.py /this/other/command --with-param PARAMETER PARAMETER : some_sensible_default , perhaps with an explanation of why, or how to determine alternatives Editing Files In Place \u00b6 When an individual file needs to be modified in place (as opposed to replacing it outright), a Before and After quote will be provided that identifies one or more lines in the file, what the default installed version of that file looks like on that line, and what the line should look like after it has been modified, like so: /path/to/file_being_modified Before : 174 | Here is what line 174 in the file looked like before 175 | And here is what the following line looked like in the file before After : 174 | Here is what line 174 should look like after modification 175 | And here is what the following line should look like after modification: VARIABLE VARIABLE : some_value , perhaps with an explanation of why It should be noted that configuration files and the like are subject to change by the organizations that maintain their respective applications; this guide generally recommends installing the latest version of these applications, as these generally include security updates. It is expected that the implementer will be able to search through a file and find specific lines in the case where the maintaining organization has moved it in a subsequent patch. In most cases, configuration files will be provided outright to avoid these scenarios. Adding or Replacing Files \u00b6 When a file needs to be added or replaced, it will be described in three sections: A line that describes the path to the file, as well as the owner, group, and umask for the file; it is assumed that the person following the guide will use chmod and chown appropriately to apply the owner, group, and umask The entire contents of the file in a code block, including any portions that need to be replaced with specific values Those replacement values /the/path/to/some/file.php | owner:group/umask <?php /** * Here is the entire contents of a PHP file */ function do_something($to_this) { $to_this += THE_NUMBER_TO_ADD_TO_THIS; } ?> THE_NUMBER_TO_ADD_TO_THIS : 12, perhaps with an explanation of why, or other numbers that may be appropriate Troubleshooting \u00b6 The most common issues you will likely run into when manually provisioning a server are: Files or directories are not owned by the user who needs access to them, and can therefore not be written to. Check the ownership of files using ls -la , and ensure their ownership using chown USER for files, and chown -R USER for directories Replacement variables were left in place in files specified by the guide. Ensure any replacement variables such as server addresses and passwords are swapped out when writing files to the server For any other issues, don't hesitate to email the mailing list to ask for help. If you think that a part of the installation documentation is incorrect or could be improved, please create an issue in the documentation issues queue and give it a documentation tag. Bear in mind that this guide is built for Ubuntu 18.04 and attempts to give generalized instructions; you will likely naturally encounter situations where your own environment needs to differ from the guide.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"installation/manual/introduction/#introduction","text":"Notice The manual installation guide is not intended to describe the Islandora 8 installation but rather an Islandora 8 installation.

It uses RDF mappings, a concept defined by the RDF Module , and exposes them through the REST API at ?_format=jsonld . Background \u00b6 A quick overview of JSON-LD, the RDF module, and the REST API. The JSON-LD Syntax \u00b6 JSON-LD is a syntax which can be used to express RDF (like Turtle, or RDF XML), that is written in JSON, because devs like JSON and it's web-friendly. The JSON-LD syntax was designed for including Linked Data within HTML of web pages (similar to microdata or RDFa). Instead of nesting the RDF predicates within existing HTML tags as RDFa does, JSON-LD lets you put a solid blob of Linked Data inside a <script> tag. JSON-LD can also function as a standalone document, which is how we're using it. RDF (Drupal Module) \u00b6 The RDF Module is part of Drupal Core, but has no official documentation. The RDF Module embeds RDFa, a form of linked data, within the Drupal-generated HTML when you load the web page for a node, media, or taxonomy term. Official line is that this will allow Google to provide \"rich snippets\" such as star-ratings, contact info, and business hours. As an example of Drupal-provided RDFa: <h1 class=\"page-header\"> <span property=\"schema:title\">My cat</span> </h1> The property=\"schema:title\" is markup generated by Drupal's RDF module that identifies the value \"My cat\" as the schema.org title of this page. A node's fields (such as field_tags ) and properties (such as author ) can be mapped to RDF according to a bundle-specific \"mapping\" that is stored within Drupal. In Drupal8-ese, RDF mappings are configuration entities. Drupal doesn't have a good UI for editing RDF mappings, but you can create, read, and update them as YAML files using Drupal's Configuration Synchronization interface (see section below on How to Edit an RDF Mapping).. REST API \u00b6 The pattern of using ?_format= to get a different representation of content is provided by the RESTful Web Services (rest) module. It allows other services to interact with Drupal entities through HTTP requests ( GET , POST , PATCH , and DELETE ). Which operations are allowed, and with what formats (such as xml , json , and jsonld ) is configured at admin/config/services/rest/ . Note that only jsonld uses RDF mappings; the json and xml formats expose a structured object based on how Drupal sees the entity. Access to these alternate formats throught the REST API corresponds to permissions on the entity, so anyone with access content permission can view the JSON-LD version of that content. This is new as of Drupal 8.2 . For more information on interacting with Drupal entities via REST requests, see An Introduction to RESTful Web Services in Drupal 8 . JSON-LD Module \u00b6 Using the RDF mapping configurations provided by the RDF module, the JSON-LD Module exposes the RDF-mapped entity in JSON-LD, through the REST API, at node/[nid]?_format=jsonld (for nodes; for media and terms, at media/[mid]?_format=jsonld and taxonomy/term/[tid]?_format=jsonld ). The JSON-LD module will only work with mappings that include a value under types (which maps to rdf:type - see below, under Structure of an RDF Mapping). The JSON-LD module provides a hook so other modules can alter the entity before it gets mapped. The islandora module uses this hook to trigger any \"Map URI to Predicate\" and \"Alter JSON-LD Type\" reactions that are configured in Contexts. islandora_defaults provides the two Contexts - \"All Media\" and \"Content\" - that configure these to occur on Media and Repository Item nodes. The JSON-LD module adds RDF datatypes to the RDF values, and includes a mapping of Drupal field types to RDF datatypes. The JSON-LD module provides a hook to alter its Drupal field type to RDF datatype mapping. The JSON-LD module has a configuration option that can cause the ?_format=jsonld to be part of, or not part of, the URIs of Drupal objects. On an out-of-the-box islandora-playbook, this string is stripped, but by default on a fresh install of the jsonld module, it is not. RDF Mappings \u00b6 In an out-of-the-box islandora-playbook, the RDF mappings that exist were loaded from config files, and correspond to the rdf.mapping.[...].yml files located in: [drupal modules directory]/islandora/modules/islandora_core_feature/config/install/ (media and taxonomy terms) [drupal modules directory]/islandora_defaults/config/install/ ( repository_item and the islandora_access vocabulary) [drupal modules directory]/controlled_access_terms/modules/controlled_access_terms_defaults/config/install/ (the default corporate_body , family , geo_location , person , resource_type and subject vocabularies) [drupal web root]/core/profiles/standard/config/install/ (articles, pages, comments, and tags). Once loaded by modules, configuration .yml files are not live so editing them will not change the existing configuration . However, for modules that are Features, it is possible to re-import the changed configuration files at admin/config/development/features (todo: link to further reading on Features). How to edit an RDF Mapping \u00b6 Once loaded, RDF mappings can be customized for the needs of a particular site through Drupal's Configuration Synchronization UI at admin/config/development/configuration . They can be exported, modified, and re-imported one-at-a-time by choosing the \"Single Item\" option on the Export/Import tabs. You can also create new RDF mappings (e.g. for a custom content type) and load them through this interface, by copying an existing mapping and changing the appropriate values. Contributed module for RDF Mappings A custom module rdfui exists, and is installed-but-not-enabled on boxes provisioned by the islandora-playbook. We don't use it because it is very rudimentary and limited to the schema.org vocabulary. We have an open ticket to develop a UI to support RDF mappings to any ontology. Contributions welcome. A number of namespaces such as ldp , ebucore , pcdm , are premis are registered in islandora.module using hook_rdf_namespaces() . To register your own namespaces, you will need to create a custom module that implements that hook. If you import a configuration that uses a namespace that is not registered, bad things will happen silently. Structure of an RDF Mapping \u00b6 Below is an example of an RDF mapping as a .yml (YAML) file. It is the current version of the RDF mapping of the Repository Item ( islandora_object ) bundle, provided by islandora_defaults and exportable as rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml ). The top level key types specifies the rdf:type of the resource or content model. field_model , a required field of Islandora objects, also gets mapped to rdf:type through an arcane back-end process. The top level key fieldMappings specifies fields attached to that bundle and their RDF property mappings. One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property. It is a simple flat list. Mapping Types \u00b6 mapping_type: : There are several mapping types which are provided out of the box. - rel - standing for relationship, expresses a relationship between two resources - property - the default, or if a relationship is not provided, expresses the relationship between a resource and some literal text. Datatype Callbacks \u00b6 datatype_callback : This is a custom function that transforms the output of the field. There are some provided to us by Drupal and some added by Islandora, such as: - Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value which converts dates to Iso format - Drupal\\jsonld\\EntityReferenceConverter::linkFieldPassthrough which converts a referenced entity to the URI on the entity (which is configurable with the link_field argument An example usage of the Drupal\\jsonld\\EntityReferenceConverter::linkFieldPassthrough is as follows: field_subject: properties: - 'dcterms:subject' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\jsonld\\EntityReferenceConverter::linkFieldPassthrough' arguments: link_field: 'field_authority_link' Which would convert a reference to the subject's taxonomy term entity to a reference to the URI provided in field_authority_link of that subject's taxonomy term entity.

The JSON-LD syntax was designed for including Linked Data within HTML of web pages (similar to microdata or RDFa). Instead of nesting the RDF predicates within existing HTML tags as RDFa does, JSON-LD lets you put a solid blob of Linked Data inside a <script> tag. JSON-LD can also function as a standalone document, which is how we're using it.","title":"The JSON-LD Syntax"},{"location":"islandora/rdf-mapping/#rdf-drupal-module","text":"The RDF Module is part of Drupal Core, but has no official documentation. The RDF Module embeds RDFa, a form of linked data, within the Drupal-generated HTML when you load the web page for a node, media, or taxonomy term. Official line is that this will allow Google to provide \"rich snippets\" such as star-ratings, contact info, and business hours. As an example of Drupal-provided RDFa: <h1 class=\"page-header\"> <span property=\"schema:title\">My cat</span> </h1> The property=\"schema:title\" is markup generated by Drupal's RDF module that identifies the value \"My cat\" as the schema.org title of this page. A node's fields (such as field_tags ) and properties (such as author ) can be mapped to RDF according to a bundle-specific \"mapping\" that is stored within Drupal. In Drupal8-ese, RDF mappings are configuration entities.

Note that only jsonld uses RDF mappings; the json and xml formats expose a structured object based on how Drupal sees the entity.

The JSON-LD module will only work with mappings that include a value under types (which maps to rdf:type - see below, under Structure of an RDF Mapping). The JSON-LD module provides a hook so other modules can alter the entity before it gets mapped. The islandora module uses this hook to trigger any \"Map URI to Predicate\" and \"Alter JSON-LD Type\" reactions that are configured in Contexts. islandora_defaults provides the two Contexts - \"All Media\" and \"Content\" - that configure these to occur on Media and Repository Item nodes. The JSON-LD module adds RDF datatypes to the RDF values, and includes a mapping of Drupal field types to RDF datatypes. The JSON-LD module provides a hook to alter its Drupal field type to RDF datatype mapping. The JSON-LD module has a configuration option that can cause the ?_format=jsonld to be part of, or not part of, the URIs of Drupal objects.

Background \u00b6 \" Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP\" which allows applications to read from and write to a variety of data source beyond the local file system, such as an SFTP server , Amazon S3 , and Zip files provided an Adapter is available to support it. Flysystem Adapters extend a single class implementing League\\Flysystem\\FilesystemInterface although some separate adapter traits for common actions and properties, such as the StreamedCopyTrait, are available. The Drupal Flysystem module extends Flysystem to work within the Drupal filesystem structure. Drupal flysystem plugins include a Flysystem adapter (if not provided by default or in another library) and a class implementing Drupal\\flysystem\\Plugin\\FlysystemPluginInterface which instantiates the Flysystem adapter based on the Drupal site's configuration. The Drupal Flysystem module uses flysystem stream wrappers to define filesystem descriptors which are configured in the site's settings.php file. The configurations including the filesystem prefix, adapter (driver), and any adapter-specific configurations such as API endpoints and authorization information. Islandora's Implementation \u00b6 The Plugin and Adapter \u00b6 Islandora 8 implements a Flysystem adapter and a Drupal Flysystem plugin . The Flysystem adapter acts as an intermediary between the Flysystem filesystem API and Fedora, translating requests and responses between them. The adapter interacts with Fedora using an instance of the Chullo Fedora API it receives from the Drupal Flysystem plugin. The Drupal Flysystem plugin's main responsibility is to instantiate the Chullo Fedora API object with the proper authentication and pass it to the Flysystem adapter. To authenticate with Fedora the plugin adds a handler to the Chullo's Guzzle client which adds a JWT authentication header to each request. The Fedora Flysystem adapter does not use Gemini to map the relationship between Drupal URIs and Fedora URIs, so they are indexed separately using the \"files_in_fedora\" Context which triggers the \"Index Fedora File in Gemini\" and \"Delete Fedora File in Gemini\" actions as appropriate. Configuration \u00b6 The fedora file system is configured in the site's settings.php file. An example configuration can be seen in the claw-playbook web server role's drupal tasks : $settings['flysystem'] = [ 'fedora' => [ 'driver' => 'fedora', 'config' => [ 'root' => 'http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/rest/', ], ], ]; The configuration array's top-level key is the name of the Drupal stream wrapper, which also serves as the filesystem prefix. Any Drupal file path using \"fedora://\" will use this Flysystem adapter. Drupal will translate this prefix to the site's domain plus \"_flystem/fedora/\". For example, using the default configuration provided by the claw-playbook, a file stored at \"fedora://test.tif\" will persist to Fedora with the URI \"http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/rest/test.tif\" and will be accessible from the Drupal URL \"http://localhost:8000/_flysystem/fedora/test.tif\". The 'driver' value 'fedora' corresponds to the plugin's machine name . The 'config' section contains all the adapter-specific configurations. In this case, the only thing configured for the site is the Fedora REST end-point. (Change this value to match your own Fedora's location, if needed.) The JWT is configured separately. Other examples of Drupal Flysystem configurations can be seen in the module's README . Islandora is configured to have all Media use the Fedora file system by default in the islandora_core_feature. For example, the field storage uri_scheme setting for field_media_image (and the other media types) is \"fedora\".

For example, if I upload a Tiff to a repository item as a File Media with the term \"Original File\", the \"Image Original File\" ( image_original_file ) Context is triggered. This fires the 'image_generate_a_service_file_from_an_original_file' action which emits an event using the 'public' scheme (file system) .

Whether you will eventually use CSVs or other sources (such as XML or directly from a 7.x Islandora) this tutorial should be useful as it covers the basics and mechanics of migration. This tutorial uses the configurations and code available in the migrate_islandora_csv module which, when enabled, will create three example migrations ready for you to use with the Migrate API. Each migration comes from one of the files in the config/install folder. We'll walk through them in detail below. The module is also uses Features which allows you to make changes to the configuration files and sync those changes into your Drupal site. A note on using Features This tutorial (and Islandora in general) makes heavy use of Features, which is an easy way to ship and install Drupal configuration. However, after enabling a Feature module, the code in that module's directory is no longer \"live\", as the configuration now resides in the Drupal database. If you change code in the YAML files, it will not take effect until you re-import the Feature. There is a walkthrough in the \"Configuration\" section of the Migrate 7.x to 8 tutorial. Sample CSV and images are also included in the module as a convenience so they are easily available on the Drupal server running the migration. (This is not the recommended method for making files available to Drupal in a real migration.) The module also contains a Migrate process plugin that transforms strings into associative arrays. This is useful for populating multiple Linked Agent fields. (See \" Typed Relation \" for more information on the Linked Agent field.) It will be available when this module is enabled, and the node migration uses it. It was written generically and will hopefully become part of Migrate Plus, but for now it is here. When you are ready to create your actual migrations, the contents of this repository can function as a template for you to create the YAML files defining your own migrations. Introduction \u00b6 Why CSV? CSV files (whether separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters) are easy to understand and work with, and there's good tooling available for using them with Drupal 8's Migrate API . The Drupal contrib module migrate_source_csv provides a source plugin that reads from a CSV file, and migrate_plus provides more tools and flexibility for creating migrations, including the ability to create customized migrations using YAML and package them up as Features . In this tutorial, we'll be inspecting each migration file in detail before running it. You'll start out by migrating the images themselves first, and then you'll create various Drupal entities to describe the files from the metadata in the CSV. It's not as scary as it sounds (especially since this module contains the data we'll be using in a data directory), but you will need a few things before beginning: An instance of Islandora 8. Use Islandora 8 playbook to spin up an environment pre-loaded with all the modules you need (except this one) Some basic command line skills. You won't need to know much, but you'll have to vagrant ssh into the box, navigate into Drupal, and use git and drush , etc... If you can copy/paste into a terminal, you'll survive. A big part of this tutorial relies on the islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms_defaults features, which define the default metadata profile for Islandora (which we'll be migrating into). You're not required to use the islandora_defaults or controlled_access_terms_defaults for your repository, but for the purposes of demonstration, it saves you a lot of user interface administrivia so you can focus just on the learning how to migrate. By the time you are done with this exercise, you'll be able to easily apply your knowledge to migrate using any custom metadata profile you can build using Drupal. Overview \u00b6 The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it's up to you to create the rules that take data from a source , through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination . A set of these rules is called a \"migration\". It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run. Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that's taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora 8 is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it's going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it's important to perform these migrations in a sensible order. A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together. Therefore, each row in your CSV must contain enough information to create these. Using multiple sources for object components While this tutorial uses a single CSV to describe all the parts of an islandora object, a site can use multiple sources (CSV or otherwise) to migrate the various parts. The only requirements then is to have keys in place matching the parts together. For example, a 'files.csv' can use paths that serve as file identifiers and 'metadata.csv' can use an object identifier. As long as the source for the media migration has the key values for the file and metadata migrations (the file paths and object identifiers, respectively, in this example), we can create the necessary links between the object's components. This is very useful when you need to migrate multiple media/file pairs associated with a single node, such as pre-processed derivatives that need to be migrated. Buried in your descriptive metadata are often references to other things which aren't repository items themselves, but records still need to be kept for them. Authors, publishers, universities, places, etc... can be modeled as Drupal Entities, so that they can be referenced by other Entities. So there's the potential to have a lot of different entity types described in a single row in a CSV. In this tutorial, we're working with islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms entities, and will be migrating six entity types using the three migrations included in this module. - file - node - media - subject - person - corporate_body We can do this because subjects, persons, and corporate bodies are (in this example) represented by simple 'name' strings. We create them on the fly, as if we were adding new tags to a tag vocabulary. If we wanted to model subjects, people, or corporate bodies as entities with multiple fields (first name, last name, date, subheadings, URI, etc.) then we would need up to six migrations. Migrations follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern . You extract the information from a source, process the data to transform it into the format you need, and load it into the destination system (i.e. Drupal). Migrations are stored in Drupal as configuration, which means they can be represented in YAML, transferred to and from different sites, and are compatible with Drupal's configuration synchronization tools. And the structure of each YAML file is arranged to follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern. To perform the migrations, we'll be using drush . We will be able to run each of the file, node, and media migrations separately or all at once in a group. We will also learn how to roll back a migration in case it didn't go as planned. The sample migrations here will give us a chance to show off some techniques for working with multi-valued fields, entity reference fields, and complex field types like controlled_access_terms 's typed_relation field. We'll also see how the migrate framework can help de-duplicate, and at the same time, linked data-ize :tm: your data by looking up previously migrated entities. So hold on to your hats. First, let's get this module onto your Islandora instance. Installation \u00b6 From your islandora-playbook directory, issue the following commands to enable this module: - vagrant ssh to open a shell in your Islandora instance. - cd /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib to get to your modules directory. - git clone https://github.com/Islandora/migrate_islandora_csv to clone down the repository from GitHub. - drush en -y migrate_islandora_csv to enable the module, installing the migrations as configuration. Optionally, flush the cache ( drush cr ), so the migrations become visible in the GUI at Manage > Structure > Migrations > migrate_islandora_csv (http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/migrate/manage/migrate_islandora_csv/migrations) Now lets go migrate some files. Caution As you saw, you can git clone into the modules directory, but if you're installing a custom module that's intended to stay installed for the long term (unlike a migration feature, which you should probably uninstall and delete when you're done with it) then you may want to check with your devops folks and use Composer instead. However, using Git directly allows you to be more flexible when iterating and testing. Ingesting Files \u00b6 To migrate files (i.e. just the raw binaries) from a CSV, you need: - a column in the CSV containing paths to the files you wish to ingest, and - the files need to be accessible from the server that's running Drupal so that the Migrate framework can find them. This tutorial assumes you're working with the sample images provided in the module, which will be located at /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images . When you're migrating for real, the files will have to be uploaded or otherwise made accessible to the server before this point. Open up the CSV file at data/migration.csv and you'll see a file column containing paths to the sample images. You can use your favorite shell-based utility to open it at /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv , or browse to it on GitHub, or just look at it pasted below as this tutorial does not require you to edit the files. file /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Nails Nails Nails.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Nothing to See Here.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Call For Champagne.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/This Must Be The Place.jpg Open up the \"files\" migration at config/install/migrate_plus.migration.file.yml . You'll see the following migration config: id: file label: Import Image Files migration_group: migrate_islandora_csv source: plugin: csv path: '/var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv' delimiter: ',' # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't header_row_count: 1 # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the CSV. Here we're using the file path. keys: - file # You can't enter string literals into a process plugin, but you can give it a constant as a 'source'. constants: # Islandora uses Flysystem and stream wrappers to work with files. What we're really saying here is # to put these files in Fedora in a 'csv_migration' folder. It doesn't matter if the directory # doesn't exist yet, it will get created for you automatically. destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' process: ## # The following two fields are temporary, and just used to generate a destination for the file. ## # Hack the file name out of the full path provided in the 'file' column. filename: - plugin: callback callable: pathinfo source: file - plugin: extract index: - basename # Construct the destination URI using the file name. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - constants/destination_dir - '@filename' ## # Here's where we copy the file over and set the URI of the file entity. ## uri: plugin: file_copy source: - file # The source column in the CSV - '@destination' # The destination entry from above destination: # These are Drupal 'image' entities we're making, not just plain 'file' entities. plugin: 'entity:file' type: image Anatomy of a Migration \u00b6 It seems like a lot to take in at first, but there's a pattern to Drupal migrations. They always contain core identification information and three key sections: source , process , and destination . And these sections correspond exactly to Extract, Transform, and Load. Identification \u00b6 The first section of a migration contains metadata for Drupal about the migration itself. The id parameter is the machine name of this migration, and must not conflict with existing migrations. Note: use alphanumeric characters and underscores. Hyphens (-) will cause the migration to fail. The label is a human-readable string to identify this migration, and the migration_group is where this migration will be grouped in the GUI. Source \u00b6 The source section configures a Drupal source plugin that will extract the data. A source plugin provides \"rows\" of data to processing plugins so that they can be worked on. In this case, we're using the csv source plugin, which very literally uses rows, however you can have source plugins that work with other data formats like XML and JSON. Look at the config from this section. source: plugin: csv path: '/var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv' delimiter: ',' header_row_count: 1 keys: - file constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' You can see we provide a path to its location, what delimiter to use, if it uses a header row, and which column contains a unique key for each entry. Constants can also be defined here (more on those later). Process \u00b6 We're going to dive into the details of this step below, but in summary: the process section is where we extract the desired bits from that row, transform them as desired, and populate them into an associative array. This section is a series of named steps, that call one or more process plugins. These plugins are executed in sequence, with the results getting passed from one to the next, forming a pipeline. By the end of the step, you have transformed some element of data (perhaps through text manipulation, concatenation, etc...) into the form that Drupal is expecting. The resulting value gets associated with the name of the step. If the name of a step is the same as a field or property name on the target entity, the migrated entity will have that value for that field or property. This is how you can apply metadata from the CSV to an entity. If the step name is not the name of a field or property on the target entity, the migrate framework assumes it's a temporary value you're using as part of more complex logic. It won't wind up on the entity when the migration is done, but it will be available for you to use within other process plugins. You can always spot when a temporary value is being used by the fact that it's prefixed with an @ and surrounded by quotes. You can also pass constants into process plugins, which are prefixed with constants/ . Destination \u00b6 The destination section contains the configuration that describes what gets loaded into Drupal. destination: plugin: 'entity:file' type: image You can create any type of content entity in Drupal. In this case, we're making file entities. Specifically, we're making images, which are a special type of file entity that's provided by core Drupal. The Process Section in Depth \u00b6 In the process section of the migration, we're copying the images over into a Drupal file system and setting the uri property on the corresponding File entity. uri: plugin: file_copy source: - file - '@destination' To do this, we're using the file_copy process plugin. But first, we have to know where a file is located and where it should be copied to. We know where the file resides, we have that in the CSV's file column. But we're going to have to do some string manipulation in order to generate the new location where we want the file copied. We're trying to convert something like /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg . The URI we're constructing is a stream wrapper of the form scheme://path/to/file . Islandora uses Flysystem , which allows for integration with many different types of filesystems, both remote and local. With Flysystem , the scheme part of the URI is the name of a filesystem. By default, Fedora is exposed using the scheme fedora:// . So by setting uri to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg , we're saying \"put Free Smells.jpg in the csv_migration directory in Fedora.\" Now, to perform this string manipulation in PHP, we'd do something like $info = pathinfo($filepath); $filename = $info['basename']; $destination = \"fedora://csv_migration/\" . $filename; We will mimic this exactly in the process section of our migration config. Just like we declare variables and call functions with PHP code, we can make entries in the process section to store the output of Drupal process plugins. We'll build up a destination \"variable\" using a filename \"variable\" and pass it into the file_copy process plugin. To start, we'll get the filename using two process plugins, which do the same steps as the first two lines of the PHP above: filename: - plugin: callback callable: pathinfo source: file - plugin: extract index: - basename The first process plugin, callback , lets you execute any PHP function that takes a single input and returns an output. It's not as flexible as making your own custom process plugin, but it's still pretty useful in a lot of situations. Here we're using it to call pathinfo() , telling it to use the file column in the CSV as input. We pass the resulting array from pathinfo() to the extract process plugin, which pulls data out of arrays using the keys you provide it under index . Now that we have the file name, we have to prepend it with fedora://csv_migration/ to make the destination URI. In our PHP code above, we used . to concatenate the strings. In the migration framework, we use the concat process plugin. You provide it with two or more strings to concatenate, as well as a delimiter. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - constants/destination_dir - '@filename' In our PHP code, we concatenated the $filename variable with a string literal. In our process plugin, we can provide the variable, e.g. the output of the filename process step, by prefixing it with an @ . We can't, however, pass in fedora://csv_migration directly as a string. At first glance, you might think something like this would work, but it totally doesn't: # Can't do this. Won't work at all. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - 'fedora://csv_migration' - '@filename' That's because the migrate framework only interprets source values as names of columns from the CSV or names of other process steps. Even if they're wrapped in quotes. It will never try to use the string directly as a value. To circumvent this, we declare a constant in the source section of the migration config. constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' This constant can be referenced as constants/destination_dir and passed into the concat process plugin as a source . There are a lot more process plugins available through the (core) Migrate and Migrate Plus modules, and they are documented on Drupal.org . Running the File Migration \u00b6 Migrations can be executed via drush using the migrate:import command. You specify which migration to run by using the id defined in its YAML. You also need to set parameters to tell Drush who you are and what your site's URL is. Failing to do so will result in derivatives not being generated and malformed/improper RDF. So don't forget them! To run the file migration from the command line, make sure you're within /var/www/html/drupal/web (or any subdirectory) and enter drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file If you've already run the migration before, but want to re-run it for any reason, use the --update flag. drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file --update You may have noticed that migrations can be grouped, and that they define a migration_group in their configuration. You can execute an entire group of migrations using the --group flag. For example, to run the entire group defined in this module drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import --group migrate_islandora_csv You can also use the migrate:rollback command to delete all migrated entities. Like migrate:import , it also respects the --group flag and --uri parameter. So to rollback everything we just did: drush -y --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv If something goes bad during development, sometimes migrations can get stuck in a bad state. Use the migrate:reset command to put a migration back to Idle . For example, with the file migration, use drush -y --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:reset file Make sure you've run (and not rolled back) the file migration. It should tell you that it successfully created 5 files. You can confirm its success by visiting http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files. You should see 5 images of neon signs in the list. Ingesting Nodes \u00b6 Those five images are nice, but we need something to hold their descriptive metadata and show them off. We use nodes in Drupal to do this, and that means we have another migration file to work with. Nestled in with our nodes' descriptive metadata, though, are more Drupal entities, and we're going to generate them on the fly while we're making nodes. While we're doing it, we'll see how to use pipe delimited strings for multiple values as well as how to handle typed_relation fields that are provided by controlled_access_terms .

If values contained special characters such as colons, quotes would be needed. If you look at the process section, you can see we're taking the title , description , and issued columns from the CSV and applying them directly to the migrated nodes without any manipulation. title: title field_description: description field_edtf_date: issued For subtitle , we're passing it through the skip_on_empty process plugin because not every row in our CSV has a subtitle entry. It's very useful when you have spotty data, and you'll end up using it a lot. The method: process bit tells the migrate framework only skip that particular field if the value is empty, and not to skip the whole row. It's important, so don't forget it. The full YAML for setting field_alternative_title from subtitle looks like this: field_alternative_title: plugin: skip_on_empty source: subtitle method: process Now here's where things get interesting. We can look up other entities to populate entity reference fields. For example, all Repository Items have an entity reference field that holds a taxonomy term from the islandora_models vocabulary. All of our examples are images, so we'll look up the Image model in the vocabulary since it already exists (it gets made for you when you use islandora-playbook). We use the entity_lookup process plugin to do this. field_model: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/model entity_type: taxonomy_term # 'name' is the string value of the term, e.g. 'Original file', 'Thumbnail'. value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models The entity_lookup process plugin looks up an entity based on the configuration you give it. You use the entity_type , bundle_key , and bundle configurations to limit which entities you search through. entity_type is, as you'd suspect, the type of entity: node, media, file, taxonomy_term, etc... bundle_key tells the migrate framework which property holds the bundle of the entity, and bundle is the actual bundle id you want to restrict by. In this case we specify the vid (vocabulary id) has to be islandora_models - which is the machine name of the vocabulary we're interested in. In this plugin, source is the value to search for - in this case we're looking for the string \"Image\", which we've defined as a constant. And we're comparing it to the name field on each term by setting the value_key config. This approach applies the same taxonomy term to all objects. If you want to assign a taxonomy term at the node level (that is, potentially a different term for each node) rather than to all the nodes being imported, you can use a configuration as illustrated next. In this example, we have a column in our CSV input file with the header 'model', which we define as the source of the field_model values: field_model: plugin: entity_lookup # 'model' is the header of a field in our input CSV that contains the string value of the taxonomy term. source: model entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models If you're not sure that the entities you're looking up already exist, you can use the entity_generate plugin, which takes the same config, but will create a new entity if the lookup fails. We use this plugin to create subject taxonomy terms that we tag our nodes with. A node can have multiple subjects, so we've encoded them in the CSV as pipe delimited strings. subject Neon signs|Night Neon signs|Night|Funny Neon signs|Night Drinking|Neon signs Neon signs We can hack those apart easily enough. In PHP we'd do something like $subjects = explode($string, '|'); $terms = []; foreach ($subjects as $name) { $terms[] = \\Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')->getStorage('taxonomy_term')->create([ ... 'vid' => 'subject', 'name' => $name, ... ]); } $node->set('field_subject', $terms); With process plugins, that logic looks like field_subject: - plugin: skip_on_empty source: subject method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: entity_generate entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: subject Here we've got a small pipeline that uses the skip_on_empty process plugin, which we've already seen, followed by explode . The explode process plugin operates exactly like its PHP counterpart, taking an array and a delimiter as input. The combination of skip_on_empty and explode behave like a foreach loop on the explode results. If we have an empty string, nothing happens. If there's one or more pipe delimited subject names in the string, then entity_generate gets called for each name that's found. The entity_generate process plugin will try to look up a subject by name, and if that fails, it creates one using the name and saves a reference to it in the node. So entity_generate is actually smarter than our pseudo-code above, because it can be run over and over again and it won't duplicate entities. :champagne: Complex Fields \u00b6 Some fields don't hold just a single type of value. In other words, not everything is just text, numbers, or references. Using Drupal 8's Typed Data API , fields can hold groups of named values with different types. Consider a field that holds an RGB color. You could set it with PHP like so: $node->set('field_color', ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255]); You could even have a multi-valued color field, and do something like this $node->set('field_color', [ ['R' => 0, 'G' => 0, 'B' => 0], ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255], ]); In the migrate framework, you have two options for handling these types of fields. You can build up the full array they're expecting, which is difficult and requires a custom process plugin. Or, if you only have one value going into a complex field, you can set each named component in the field with separate process pipelines. In controlled_access_terms , we define a new field type of typed_relation , which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. It expects an associative array that looks like this: [ 'target_id' => 1, 'rel_type' => 'relators:ctb'] The target_id portion takes an entity id, and rel_type takes the predicate for the MARC relator we want to use to describe the relationship the entity has with the repository item. This example would reference taxonomy_term 1 and give it the relator for \"Contributor\". If we have a single name to deal with, we can set those values in YAML, accessing field_linked_agent/target_id and field_linked_agent/rel_type independently. field_linked_agent/target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: photographer entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person field_linked_agent/rel_type: constants/relator Here we're looking at the photographer column in the CSV, which contains the names of the photographers that captured these images. Since we know these are photographers, and not publishers or editors, we can bake in the relator constant we set to relators:pht in the source section of the migration. So all that's left to do is to set the taxonomy term's id via entity_generate . If the lookup succeeds, the id is returned. If it fails, a term is created and its id is returned. In the end, by using the / syntax to set properties on complex fields, everything gets wrapped up into that nice associative array structure for you automatically. However, if you have multiple names, and/or multiple columns that contain values that will go into the same typed_relation field, you do need to build up a full array of structured data. We start by extracting the values in the photographer column, and busting them into a list. (In this case, given the sample data, the lists will all have length 1). Then, we use a custom process plugin to make each value the value in an associative array (see example data below). photographers: - source: photographer plugin: skip_on_empty method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: str_to_assoc key: 'name' So, if we started with a column containing 'Alice|Bob|Charlie' at the end of this pipeline, the photographers temporary variable would contain [ ['name' => 'Alice'], ['name' => 'Bob'], ['name' => 'Charlie] ] Next, we use the sub_process plugin. It takes an array of associative arrays (as seen above) and iterates over them. From within subprocess' process parameter, you can access only what's defined in that associative array. Here, when we do our entity_generate lookup, our source is name , the (only) key in that array. linked_agent_pht: plugin: sub_process source: '@photographers' process: target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: name entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person rel_type: plugin: default_value default_value: 'relators:pht' Within sub_process , we cannot access the temporary variables or constants that we've created in the outer migration. This is why we use the default_value plugin when for the rel_type . It would have been simpler to define a constant as we did with 'Image', but we wouldn't be able to access it. The output of this pipeline is now formatted as the structured data expected by a typed_relation field: [ ['target_id' => 42, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 43, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 44, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ] The final step will be to assign this array to the Linked Agent field. But first, we repeat the process for another column, which contains names that have a different relator, and a different bundle. Finally, we merge the two temporary variables and pass the result to field_linked_agent . We don't have to assign the sub-components of field_linked_agent here, because this is already the structured data it is looking for. field_linked_agent: plugin: merge source: - '@linked_agent_pht' - '@linked_agent_prv' Clear as mud? Great. Now let's run that migration. Running the node migration \u00b6 Like with the file migration, run drush -y --userid=1 --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import node from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory will fire off the migration. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/content and you should see five new nodes. Click on one, though, and you'll see it's just a stub with metadata. The CSV metadata is there, links to other entities like subjects and photographers are there, but there's no trace of the corresponding files. Here's where media entities come into play. Migrating Media \u00b6 Media entities are Drupal's solution for fieldable files. Since you can't put fields on a file, what you can do is wrap the file with a Media entity. In addition to a reference to the file (binary), technical metadata and structural metadata for the file go on the Media entity (e.g. MIME type, file size, resolution). Media also have a few special fields that are required for Islandora, field_media_of and field_use , which denote what node owns the media and what role the media serves, respectively. Since the Media entity references both the file it wraps and the node that owns it, Media entities act as a bridge between files and nodes, tying them together. And to do this, we make use of one last process plugin, migration_lookup . Open up /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.media.yml and give it a look. # Uninstall this config when the feature is uninstalled dependencies: enforced: module: - migrate_islandora_csv id: media label: Import Media from CSV migration_group: migrate_islandora_csv source: plugin: csv path: modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't header_row_count: 1 # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the csv.

There's no string or array manipulation in YAML, and at most there's only one process plugin per field. Title and user are set directly, with no processing required name: title uid: constants/uid The field_media_use field is a tag that's used to denote the purpose of a file with regard to the node it belongs to. E.g. is this the original file? a lower quality derivative? thumbnail? etc... In many ways it bears a resemblance to DSID in Islandora 7.x. Like field_model with nodes, the vocabulary already exists in your Islandora install, so all you have to do is look it up with the entity_lookup plugin. # Make the media an 'Original File' field_media_use: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/use entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_media_use The field_media_image and field_media_of fields are how the media binds a file to a node. You could use entity_lookup or entity_generate , but we've already migrated them and can very easily look them up by the id assigned to them during migration. But what's the benefit of doing so? The entity_lookup and entity_generate process plugins do the job fine, right? The main advantage of using migration_lookup and defining migrations whenever possible, is that migrated entities can be rolled back. If you were to hop into your console and execute drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv Your nodes, media, and files would all be gone. But your subjects and photographers would remain. If you want to truly and cleanly roll back every entity in a migration, you need to define those migrations and use migration_lookup to set entity reference fields. Running the media migration \u00b6 Run drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import media from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory. You should now be able to see the media files attached to the nodes you created earlier. At this point, you might want to create derivatives, such as thumbnails, using the appropriate Drupal actions on the main content admin window. What have we learned? \u00b6 If you've made it all the way to the end here, then you've learned that you can migrate files and CSV metadata into Islandora using only YAML files. You've seen how to transform data with pipelines of processing plugins and can handle numeric, text, and entity reference fields. You can handle multiple values for fields, and even more complicated things like typed_relation fields. And as big as this walkthrough was, we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with the Migrate API. Where to go from here? \u00b6 There's certainly more you can do with Drupal 8's Migrate API. There's a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. XML and JSON are fair game. You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there. If you can't make the Migrate API's existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start. But really the best thing to do is try and get your data into Islandora! We intend to create a boilerplate branch of this repository that will allow you to clone down a migration template, ready for you to customize to fit your data. And as you assemble it into CSV format, keep in mind that if you have more than just names for things like subjects and authors, that you can always make more CSVs. Think of it like maintaining tables in an SQL database. Each CSV has unique keys, so you can lookup/join entities between CSVs using those keys. And you can still pipe-delimit the keys like we did in our example to handle multi-valued fields. In some repositories, these CSVs can be used to make bulk updates to metadata. Just make your changes to maintain the CSVs, then run the migration(s) again with the --update flag. This will not always be efficient, as you'll update every entity, even if it didn't change. But, by breaking down your CSVs per collection or object type, you could keep them small enough to use this process for a small repository. There is also a tool for migrating directly from an Islandora 7.x to Islandora 8 ( migrate_7x_claw ), using Solr, XPaths, and Fedora calls to pull files and objects directly into Islandora 8. It may be worth checking out, and/or using in conjunction with a CSV migration.","title":"CSV"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#table-of-contents","text":"Summary Introduction Dependencies Overview Installation Ingesting Files Anatomy of a migration Source Process Destination The Process Section in Depth Running the File Migration Ingesting Nodes Complex Fields Running the node migration Migrating Media What have we learned Where to go from here","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#summary","text":"This tutorial introduces you to the Drupal 8 Migrate tools available to create Islandora content. Whether you will eventually use CSVs or other sources (such as XML or directly from a 7.x Islandora) this tutorial should be useful as it covers the basics and mechanics of migration. This tutorial uses the configurations and code available in the migrate_islandora_csv module which, when enabled, will create three example migrations ready for you to use with the Migrate API. Each migration comes from one of the files in the config/install folder. We'll walk through them in detail below. The module is also uses Features which allows you to make changes to the configuration files and sync those changes into your Drupal site. A note on using Features This tutorial (and Islandora in general) makes heavy use of Features, which is an easy way to ship and install Drupal configuration. However, after enabling a Feature module, the code in that module's directory is no longer \"live\", as the configuration now resides in the Drupal database. If you change code in the YAML files, it will not take effect until you re-import the Feature. There is a walkthrough in the \"Configuration\" section of the Migrate 7.x to 8 tutorial. Sample CSV and images are also included in the module as a convenience so they are easily available on the Drupal server running the migration. (This is not the recommended method for making files available to Drupal in a real migration.) The module also contains a Migrate process plugin that transforms strings into associative arrays. This is useful for populating multiple Linked Agent fields. (See \" Typed Relation \" for more information on the Linked Agent field.) It will be available when this module is enabled, and the node migration uses it. It was written generically and will hopefully become part of Migrate Plus, but for now it is here. When you are ready to create your actual migrations, the contents of this repository can function as a template for you to create the YAML files defining your own migrations.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#introduction","text":"Why CSV? CSV files (whether separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters) are easy to understand and work with, and there's good tooling available for using them with Drupal 8's Migrate API . The Drupal contrib module migrate_source_csv provides a source plugin that reads from a CSV file, and migrate_plus provides more tools and flexibility for creating migrations, including the ability to create customized migrations using YAML and package them up as Features . In this tutorial, we'll be inspecting each migration file in detail before running it. You'll start out by migrating the images themselves first, and then you'll create various Drupal entities to describe the files from the metadata in the CSV. It's not as scary as it sounds (especially since this module contains the data we'll be using in a data directory), but you will need a few things before beginning: An instance of Islandora 8. Use Islandora 8 playbook to spin up an environment pre-loaded with all the modules you need (except this one) Some basic command line skills. You won't need to know much, but you'll have to vagrant ssh into the box, navigate into Drupal, and use git and drush , etc... If you can copy/paste into a terminal, you'll survive. A big part of this tutorial relies on the islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms_defaults features, which define the default metadata profile for Islandora (which we'll be migrating into). You're not required to use the islandora_defaults or controlled_access_terms_defaults for your repository, but for the purposes of demonstration, it saves you a lot of user interface administrivia so you can focus just on the learning how to migrate. By the time you are done with this exercise, you'll be able to easily apply your knowledge to migrate using any custom metadata profile you can build using Drupal.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#overview","text":"The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it's up to you to create the rules that take data from a source , through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination . A set of these rules is called a \"migration\". It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run. Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that's taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora 8 is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it's going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it's important to perform these migrations in a sensible order. A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together. Therefore, each row in your CSV must contain enough information to create these. Using multiple sources for object components While this tutorial uses a single CSV to describe all the parts of an islandora object, a site can use multiple sources (CSV or otherwise) to migrate the various parts. The only requirements then is to have keys in place matching the parts together. For example, a 'files.csv' can use paths that serve as file identifiers and 'metadata.csv' can use an object identifier. As long as the source for the media migration has the key values for the file and metadata migrations (the file paths and object identifiers, respectively, in this example), we can create the necessary links between the object's components. This is very useful when you need to migrate multiple media/file pairs associated with a single node, such as pre-processed derivatives that need to be migrated. Buried in your descriptive metadata are often references to other things which aren't repository items themselves, but records still need to be kept for them. Authors, publishers, universities, places, etc... can be modeled as Drupal Entities, so that they can be referenced by other Entities. So there's the potential to have a lot of different entity types described in a single row in a CSV. In this tutorial, we're working with islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms entities, and will be migrating six entity types using the three migrations included in this module. - file - node - media - subject - person - corporate_body We can do this because subjects, persons, and corporate bodies are (in this example) represented by simple 'name' strings. We create them on the fly, as if we were adding new tags to a tag vocabulary. If we wanted to model subjects, people, or corporate bodies as entities with multiple fields (first name, last name, date, subheadings, URI, etc.) then we would need up to six migrations. Migrations follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern . You extract the information from a source, process the data to transform it into the format you need, and load it into the destination system (i.e. Drupal). Migrations are stored in Drupal as configuration, which means they can be represented in YAML, transferred to and from different sites, and are compatible with Drupal's configuration synchronization tools. And the structure of each YAML file is arranged to follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern. To perform the migrations, we'll be using drush . We will be able to run each of the file, node, and media migrations separately or all at once in a group. We will also learn how to roll back a migration in case it didn't go as planned. The sample migrations here will give us a chance to show off some techniques for working with multi-valued fields, entity reference fields, and complex field types like controlled_access_terms 's typed_relation field. We'll also see how the migrate framework can help de-duplicate, and at the same time, linked data-ize :tm: your data by looking up previously migrated entities. So hold on to your hats. First, let's get this module onto your Islandora instance.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#installation","text":"From your islandora-playbook directory, issue the following commands to enable this module: - vagrant ssh to open a shell in your Islandora instance. - cd /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib to get to your modules directory. - git clone https://github.com/Islandora/migrate_islandora_csv to clone down the repository from GitHub. - drush en -y migrate_islandora_csv to enable the module, installing the migrations as configuration.

Caution As you saw, you can git clone into the modules directory, but if you're installing a custom module that's intended to stay installed for the long term (unlike a migration feature, which you should probably uninstall and delete when you're done with it) then you may want to check with your devops folks and use Composer instead.

By the end of the step, you have transformed some element of data (perhaps through text manipulation, concatenation, etc...) into the form that Drupal is expecting. The resulting value gets associated with the name of the step. If the name of a step is the same as a field or property name on the target entity, the migrated entity will have that value for that field or property. This is how you can apply metadata from the CSV to an entity. If the step name is not the name of a field or property on the target entity, the migrate framework assumes it's a temporary value you're using as part of more complex logic. It won't wind up on the entity when the migration is done, but it will be available for you to use within other process plugins.

But first, we have to know where a file is located and where it should be copied to. We know where the file resides, we have that in the CSV's file column. But we're going to have to do some string manipulation in order to generate the new location where we want the file copied. We're trying to convert something like /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg . The URI we're constructing is a stream wrapper of the form scheme://path/to/file . Islandora uses Flysystem , which allows for integration with many different types of filesystems, both remote and local. With Flysystem , the scheme part of the URI is the name of a filesystem. By default, Fedora is exposed using the scheme fedora:// . So by setting uri to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg , we're saying \"put Free Smells.jpg in the csv_migration directory in Fedora.\" Now, to perform this string manipulation in PHP, we'd do something like $info = pathinfo($filepath); $filename = $info['basename']; $destination = \"fedora://csv_migration/\" . $filename; We will mimic this exactly in the process section of our migration config. Just like we declare variables and call functions with PHP code, we can make entries in the process section to store the output of Drupal process plugins. We'll build up a destination \"variable\" using a filename \"variable\" and pass it into the file_copy process plugin. To start, we'll get the filename using two process plugins, which do the same steps as the first two lines of the PHP above: filename: - plugin: callback callable: pathinfo source: file - plugin: extract index: - basename The first process plugin, callback , lets you execute any PHP function that takes a single input and returns an output. It's not as flexible as making your own custom process plugin, but it's still pretty useful in a lot of situations. Here we're using it to call pathinfo() , telling it to use the file column in the CSV as input. We pass the resulting array from pathinfo() to the extract process plugin, which pulls data out of arrays using the keys you provide it under index . Now that we have the file name, we have to prepend it with fedora://csv_migration/ to make the destination URI. In our PHP code above, we used . to concatenate the strings. In the migration framework, we use the concat process plugin. You provide it with two or more strings to concatenate, as well as a delimiter. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - constants/destination_dir - '@filename' In our PHP code, we concatenated the $filename variable with a string literal. In our process plugin, we can provide the variable, e.g. the output of the filename process step, by prefixing it with an @ . We can't, however, pass in fedora://csv_migration directly as a string. At first glance, you might think something like this would work, but it totally doesn't: # Can't do this. Won't work at all. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - 'fedora://csv_migration' - '@filename' That's because the migrate framework only interprets source values as names of columns from the CSV or names of other process steps. Even if they're wrapped in quotes. It will never try to use the string directly as a value. To circumvent this, we declare a constant in the source section of the migration config. constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' This constant can be referenced as constants/destination_dir and passed into the concat process plugin as a source . There are a lot more process plugins available through the (core) Migrate and Migrate Plus modules, and they are documented on Drupal.org .","title":"The Process Section in Depth"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#running-the-file-migration","text":"Migrations can be executed via drush using the migrate:import command.

If values contained special characters such as colons, quotes would be needed. If you look at the process section, you can see we're taking the title , description , and issued columns from the CSV and applying them directly to the migrated nodes without any manipulation. title: title field_description: description field_edtf_date: issued For subtitle , we're passing it through the skip_on_empty process plugin because not every row in our CSV has a subtitle entry. It's very useful when you have spotty data, and you'll end up using it a lot. The method: process bit tells the migrate framework only skip that particular field if the value is empty, and not to skip the whole row. It's important, so don't forget it. The full YAML for setting field_alternative_title from subtitle looks like this: field_alternative_title: plugin: skip_on_empty source: subtitle method: process Now here's where things get interesting. We can look up other entities to populate entity reference fields. For example, all Repository Items have an entity reference field that holds a taxonomy term from the islandora_models vocabulary. All of our examples are images, so we'll look up the Image model in the vocabulary since it already exists (it gets made for you when you use islandora-playbook). We use the entity_lookup process plugin to do this. field_model: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/model entity_type: taxonomy_term # 'name' is the string value of the term, e.g. 'Original file', 'Thumbnail'. value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models The entity_lookup process plugin looks up an entity based on the configuration you give it. You use the entity_type , bundle_key , and bundle configurations to limit which entities you search through. entity_type is, as you'd suspect, the type of entity: node, media, file, taxonomy_term, etc... bundle_key tells the migrate framework which property holds the bundle of the entity, and bundle is the actual bundle id you want to restrict by. In this case we specify the vid (vocabulary id) has to be islandora_models - which is the machine name of the vocabulary we're interested in. In this plugin, source is the value to search for - in this case we're looking for the string \"Image\", which we've defined as a constant. And we're comparing it to the name field on each term by setting the value_key config. This approach applies the same taxonomy term to all objects. If you want to assign a taxonomy term at the node level (that is, potentially a different term for each node) rather than to all the nodes being imported, you can use a configuration as illustrated next. In this example, we have a column in our CSV input file with the header 'model', which we define as the source of the field_model values: field_model: plugin: entity_lookup # 'model' is the header of a field in our input CSV that contains the string value of the taxonomy term. source: model entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models If you're not sure that the entities you're looking up already exist, you can use the entity_generate plugin, which takes the same config, but will create a new entity if the lookup fails. We use this plugin to create subject taxonomy terms that we tag our nodes with. A node can have multiple subjects, so we've encoded them in the CSV as pipe delimited strings. subject Neon signs|Night Neon signs|Night|Funny Neon signs|Night Drinking|Neon signs Neon signs We can hack those apart easily enough. In PHP we'd do something like $subjects = explode($string, '|'); $terms = []; foreach ($subjects as $name) { $terms[] = \\Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')->getStorage('taxonomy_term')->create([ ... 'vid' => 'subject', 'name' => $name, ... ]); } $node->set('field_subject', $terms); With process plugins, that logic looks like field_subject: - plugin: skip_on_empty source: subject method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: entity_generate entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: subject Here we've got a small pipeline that uses the skip_on_empty process plugin, which we've already seen, followed by explode . The explode process plugin operates exactly like its PHP counterpart, taking an array and a delimiter as input. The combination of skip_on_empty and explode behave like a foreach loop on the explode results. If we have an empty string, nothing happens. If there's one or more pipe delimited subject names in the string, then entity_generate gets called for each name that's found. The entity_generate process plugin will try to look up a subject by name, and if that fails, it creates one using the name and saves a reference to it in the node. So entity_generate is actually smarter than our pseudo-code above, because it can be run over and over again and it won't duplicate entities. :champagne:","title":"Ingesting Nodes"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#complex-fields","text":"Some fields don't hold just a single type of value. In other words, not everything is just text, numbers, or references. Using Drupal 8's Typed Data API , fields can hold groups of named values with different types. Consider a field that holds an RGB color. You could set it with PHP like so: $node->set('field_color', ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255]); You could even have a multi-valued color field, and do something like this $node->set('field_color', [ ['R' => 0, 'G' => 0, 'B' => 0], ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255], ]); In the migrate framework, you have two options for handling these types of fields. You can build up the full array they're expecting, which is difficult and requires a custom process plugin. Or, if you only have one value going into a complex field, you can set each named component in the field with separate process pipelines. In controlled_access_terms , we define a new field type of typed_relation , which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. It expects an associative array that looks like this: [ 'target_id' => 1, 'rel_type' => 'relators:ctb'] The target_id portion takes an entity id, and rel_type takes the predicate for the MARC relator we want to use to describe the relationship the entity has with the repository item. This example would reference taxonomy_term 1 and give it the relator for \"Contributor\". If we have a single name to deal with, we can set those values in YAML, accessing field_linked_agent/target_id and field_linked_agent/rel_type independently. field_linked_agent/target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: photographer entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person field_linked_agent/rel_type: constants/relator Here we're looking at the photographer column in the CSV, which contains the names of the photographers that captured these images. Since we know these are photographers, and not publishers or editors, we can bake in the relator constant we set to relators:pht in the source section of the migration. So all that's left to do is to set the taxonomy term's id via entity_generate . If the lookup succeeds, the id is returned. If it fails, a term is created and its id is returned. In the end, by using the / syntax to set properties on complex fields, everything gets wrapped up into that nice associative array structure for you automatically. However, if you have multiple names, and/or multiple columns that contain values that will go into the same typed_relation field, you do need to build up a full array of structured data. We start by extracting the values in the photographer column, and busting them into a list. (In this case, given the sample data, the lists will all have length 1). Then, we use a custom process plugin to make each value the value in an associative array (see example data below). photographers: - source: photographer plugin: skip_on_empty method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: str_to_assoc key: 'name' So, if we started with a column containing 'Alice|Bob|Charlie' at the end of this pipeline, the photographers temporary variable would contain [ ['name' => 'Alice'], ['name' => 'Bob'], ['name' => 'Charlie] ] Next, we use the sub_process plugin. It takes an array of associative arrays (as seen above) and iterates over them. From within subprocess' process parameter, you can access only what's defined in that associative array. Here, when we do our entity_generate lookup, our source is name , the (only) key in that array. linked_agent_pht: plugin: sub_process source: '@photographers' process: target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: name entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person rel_type: plugin: default_value default_value: 'relators:pht' Within sub_process , we cannot access the temporary variables or constants that we've created in the outer migration. This is why we use the default_value plugin when for the rel_type . It would have been simpler to define a constant as we did with 'Image', but we wouldn't be able to access it. The output of this pipeline is now formatted as the structured data expected by a typed_relation field: [ ['target_id' => 42, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 43, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 44, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ] The final step will be to assign this array to the Linked Agent field. But first, we repeat the process for another column, which contains names that have a different relator, and a different bundle. Finally, we merge the two temporary variables and pass the result to field_linked_agent . We don't have to assign the sub-components of field_linked_agent here, because this is already the structured data it is looking for. field_linked_agent: plugin: merge source: - '@linked_agent_pht' - '@linked_agent_prv' Clear as mud?

The CSV metadata is there, links to other entities like subjects and photographers are there, but there's no trace of the corresponding files. Here's where media entities come into play.","title":"Running the node migration"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#migrating-media","text":"Media entities are Drupal's solution for fieldable files. Since you can't put fields on a file, what you can do is wrap the file with a Media entity. In addition to a reference to the file (binary), technical metadata and structural metadata for the file go on the Media entity (e.g. MIME type, file size, resolution). Media also have a few special fields that are required for Islandora, field_media_of and field_use , which denote what node owns the media and what role the media serves, respectively. Since the Media entity references both the file it wraps and the node that owns it, Media entities act as a bridge between files and nodes, tying them together. And to do this, we make use of one last process plugin, migration_lookup .

There's no string or array manipulation in YAML, and at most there's only one process plugin per field. Title and user are set directly, with no processing required name: title uid: constants/uid The field_media_use field is a tag that's used to denote the purpose of a file with regard to the node it belongs to. E.g. is this the original file? a lower quality derivative? thumbnail? etc... In many ways it bears a resemblance to DSID in Islandora 7.x. Like field_model with nodes, the vocabulary already exists in your Islandora install, so all you have to do is look it up with the entity_lookup plugin. # Make the media an 'Original File' field_media_use: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/use entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_media_use The field_media_image and field_media_of fields are how the media binds a file to a node. You could use entity_lookup or entity_generate , but we've already migrated them and can very easily look them up by the id assigned to them during migration. But what's the benefit of doing so? The entity_lookup and entity_generate process plugins do the job fine, right? The main advantage of using migration_lookup and defining migrations whenever possible, is that migrated entities can be rolled back. If you were to hop into your console and execute drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv Your nodes, media, and files would all be gone. But your subjects and photographers would remain.

There's a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. XML and JSON are fair game. You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there. If you can't make the Migrate API's existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start. But really the best thing to do is try and get your data into Islandora! We intend to create a boilerplate branch of this repository that will allow you to clone down a migration template, ready for you to customize to fit your data. And as you assemble it into CSV format, keep in mind that if you have more than just names for things like subjects and authors, that you can always make more CSVs. Think of it like maintaining tables in an SQL database. Each CSV has unique keys, so you can lookup/join entities between CSVs using those keys. And you can still pipe-delimit the keys like we did in our example to handle multi-valued fields. In some repositories, these CSVs can be used to make bulk updates to metadata. Just make your changes to maintain the CSVs, then run the migration(s) again with the --update flag. This will not always be efficient, as you'll update every entity, even if it didn't change. But, by breaking down your CSVs per collection or object type, you could keep them small enough to use this process for a small repository. There is also a tool for migrating directly from an Islandora 7.x to Islandora 8 ( migrate_7x_claw ), using Solr, XPaths, and Fedora calls to pull files and objects directly into Islandora 8. It may be worth checking out, and/or using in conjunction with a CSV migration.","title":"Where to go from here?"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migration-overview/","text":"Islandora 8 Migration Overview \u00b6 This video provides an overview of the various options available to migrate data into an Islandora 8 installation.

Consequently there is a REST endpoint not listed in the REST UI, because it is not configurable and is part of the Islandora 8 system. This endpoint is available at http://localhost:8000/node/{node id}/media/{media type}/{media use} It only accepts PUT requests. If the media and file don't exist they are created, if they exist the file is updated with the new body. The node and taxonomy term are used to search (via an entity query ) for a media. If this media exists the body of the file is replaced with the new content, otherwise a new file is created to hold the contents. The tokens to this URI are as follows: node id : The numeric ID of the node you wish to link this media/file to. media type : The media type name you wish to create (i.e. image, file, audio) media use : The numeric ID of the media use taxonomy term to set for this media You can find the media use taxonomy terms at http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/islandora_media_use/overview So the body of the request is the actual binary file to upload. \ud83c\udf4e For example: With a local file called my-image.png that I wanted to link to a node with ID 3 .

Files \u00b6 Through the REST API you are accessing metadata about files, but not the actual binary object. Based on the above configuration the path for a GET request is /entity/file/{id} The file ID refers to the integer counter and not the UUID of a file. Through the UI you can go to the File listing at http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files . For the file you want to access, choose the USED IN link. That URI has the format http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files/usage/{file id} Alternatively the file ID can be found by viewing the media metadata (above section). In the above example if you look through the response from a GET request to the /media/{id} you will find a section like: \"field_media_image\": [ { \"target_id\": 3, \"alt\": null, \"title\": null, \"width\": 800, \"height\": 1333, \"target_type\": \"file\", \"target_uuid\": \"e97ad038-dcb3-4d81-aa91-c945b2fe092c\", \"url\": \"http:\\\\/\\\\/localhost:8000\\\\/sites\\\\/default\\\\/files\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service%20File.jpg\" } ], Note : Depending on the \"type\" of file (image, video, audio, file) this field will have a different name. This has both the url which is the URI to retrieve the binary content of the file as well as the target_id which is the file ID. So we can retrieve the file with a GET request to the URI http://localhost:8000/sites/default/files/2019-03/1-Service%20File.jpg .

These Link headers follow a standard format as specified in RFC8288 . Drupal already makes use of this technique for content entities, and Islandora takes it even further by providing additional Link headers that enable the client to navigate the repository and discover additional information about various resources. Because the links are returned in response headers, they can be relied upon without having to parse the message body. This makes them consistent across all serialization formats that can be returned in a message body (XML, JSON, JSONLD, etc...). As a general precaution, link headers for Drupal entities are not exposed to users that do not have the permissions to view the entity linked in the header. So making GET and HEAD requests anonymously will yield a different set of headers than what an authenticated user would see. For example, anonymous users don't have the view media permission, so they will not see the link headers for media associated with a node. Link Headers Provided by Islandora \u00b6 Alternate Representations \u00b6 Other representations generated by different serializers available through Drupal's REST API are exposed as link headers with rel=\"alternate\" and type equal to the mimetype that will be received when dereferencing the link. For example, if an entity in Drupal has a JSONLD representation, then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/node/1?_format=jsonld>; rel=\"alternate\"; type=\"application/ld+json\" Referenced Entities \u00b6 Entity reference fields are exposed as link headers with rel=\"related\" and a title equal to the entity reference field's display label. For example, if http://example.org/node/1 has an entity reference field name \"Associated Content\" that references http://example.org/node/2 , then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/node/2>; rel=\"related\"; title=\"Associated Content\" Referenced Taxonomy Terms \u00b6 Entity reference fields for taxonomy terms get special handling. The taxonomy terms used to tag content are exposed as link headers with rel=\"tag\" and a title equal to the taxonomy term's display label. If the term has an external URI in a controlled vocabulary, then that URI is provided. Otherwise, the local Drupal URI is provided. For example, if a piece of content is tagged with taxonomy/term/1 , which has a display label of \"Example Term\", then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/taxonomy/term/1>; rel=\"tag\"; title=\"Example Term\" If instead the term were to have the field_external_uri field with a value of http://exampletwo.org/vocab#term then the link header would look like Link: <http://exampletwo.org/vocab#term>; rel=\"tag\"; title=\"Example Term\" . Associated Media \u00b6 Media entities belonging to nodes are exposed as link headers with rel=\"related\" and a title equal to the display label of their field_media_use taxonomy term. For example, if a media is tagged as Original File indicating that it is the initial file uploaded, the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response for a node would look like Link: <http://example.org/media/1>; rel=\"related\"; title=\"Original File\" . Source Files \u00b6 Files that are the source for media entities are exposed as Link headers in the GET and HEAD responses with rel=\"describes\" . The endpoint to edit the contents of the source file is also exposed using rel=\"edit-media\" . For example, if http://example.org/media/1 has the source file http://example.org/file.txt , then a GET or HEAD response would contain both Link: <http://example.org/file.txt>; rel=\"describes\" Link: <http://example.org/media/1/source>; rel=\"edit-media\" Examples \u00b6 Requesting a Node \u00b6 After creating a node, adding it to a Collection, uploading a file and kicking off derivatives, the link headers returned for said node would look like the following.

Instructions for doing that are provided below. For more information about the Gemini service, see the Gemini README . Fedora URI Pseudo-field \u00b6 To display the Fedora URI pseudo-field on a Drupal node, media, or taxonomy term, go to Manage > Configuration > Islandora and select all the bundles for which you would like the Fedora URI displayed. A valid Gemini URL is required. On the playbook , Gemini is at http://localhost:8080/gemini. Once you have selected the bundles, and cleared the cache, the new pseudo-field will appear at the bottom of all display modes. You can alter where in the display the Fedora URI field appears, by going to the \"Manage Display\" page for the bundle. For example, for a Repository Item, you'd go to http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/display. In that list you should see Fedora URI which you can move around (or hide) as desired. Clearing cache may be necessary to refresh the node display.

Having a complete backup makes it easy to revert to the prior version if the update fails. * Optionally, if you made manual modifications to files like .htaccess, composer.json, or robots.txt, copy them somewhere easy to find.

Here is an overview of the steps for updating Drupal core using Composer \u00b6 Back Up First make sure you have made database and file back ups. 1) First, verify that an update of Drupal core actually is available: composer outdated \"drupal/*\" If there is no line starting with drupal/core, Composer isn't aware of any update. If there is an update, continue with the commands below. 2) Assuming you are used to updating Drupal and know all the precautions that you should take, the update is as simple as: composer update drupal/core webflo/drupal-core-require-dev \"symfony/*\" --with-dependencies If you want to know all packages that will be updated by the update command, use the --dry-run option first. Alternate syntax needed Islandora 8 is configured to use a fork of drupal-composer/drupal-project which requires a specific composer syntax used above compared to other Drupal 8 sites. In addition, if you are upgrading from 8.5 to 8.7, you need to replace \"~8.5.x\" with \"^8.7.0\" for drupal/core and webflo/drupal-core-require-dev in composer.json.

Some examples of blocks are your site's menu, breadcrumbs, search block, etc... You have a lot of control over when and where you see blocks using Drupal's administrative interface. You can create and delete blocks, as well as move them around in different locations on the page (called 'regions' in Drupal theme terminology). You can also control on which pages the blocks are visible, allowing you to conditionally show/hide them as appropriate. Blocks are made available to place by enabling the Drupal modules that provide them, and there's lots out there to choose from. Placing blocks is an essential skill for any site administrator, so let's jump right in and get our hands dirty. There are two methods discussed here: the \"Block Layout\" interface, and using \"Contexts\". There is a third option, \" Display Suite ,\" that is not discussed here. Using Block Layout \u00b6 Using the admin toolbar, navigate to Admin > Structure > Block layout (admin/structure/block). You will see a table listing all of the available regions provided by the current theme for block placement. You can switch between available themes using the tabs above the table. For each region, enabled blocks are listed and can be re-arranged. Take a look at the \"Main Content\" region for example. If you wanted to move the content above its tabs, you could drag the \"Main page content\" block above the \"Tabs\" block. If you scroll all the way down to the bottom and click the \"Save blocks\" button, now when you go to view content you should see something like this If you want to add a new block to a region, hit the \"Place block\" button for that region and you'll be brought to a modal that will let you select which block to place. After selecting your block, you will be brought to its configuration form. Here you can give the block a different title, change its region using a dropdown, and control its visibility settings by configuring various conditions. In our case, we're adding the \"Development\" block to the \"Footer\" region. And since we want to see this block everywhere, we'll leave the visibility settings alone for now. Click the \"Save block\" button, and now if we go view some content we should see the \"Development\" menu in the footer of our site. If we want to limit this eyesore to only the front page of our site, we can revisit the visibility settings of the block. Navigate to the block we just placed on the block placement page, and click its \"Configure\" button. Here you can limit the block to show only for certain roles or content types. You can also explicitly set a white or black list of pages, which is what we'll do. Click the Pages tab and you'll have a text area you can list pages in. We're going to enter <front> , which is a special value that means \"The front page of your site\". Underneath the text area, you can select whether you are showing or hiding the block for this list of pages. We want to show this only on the front page, so we'll leave it set at \"Show for the listed pages\". Click \"Save block\" and go back to a piece of content. You shouldn't see the development menu. But go to the frontpage and... Using Context \u00b6 The visibility conditions in the block placement user interface are simple and effective. They cover the majority of use cases, however, there are times when you need even more control. This is where the Context module really shines. Any condition available to the Context module can be used to control block visibility. And you can even combine conditions using Boolean (AND/OR) logic. For example, in the islandora_defaults feature, we provide a context specifically for showing a list of members of a collection. All of our content is the same content type (Repository Item), and Collections are distinguished by being tagged with the \"Collection\" taxonomy term. Using the admin toolbar, if you navigate to Admin > Structure > Context (admin/structure/context), you should see a list of all contexts available to the site. Click the \"Configure\" button on the \"Collection\" context. You can see in its \"Condition\" section, we have the \"Node has term\" condition, which checks for content tagged with the term provided by the user. In this case, it's set to look for the \"Collection\" tag. Underneath, in the \"Reaction\" section, you can see that the \"Block\" reaction has been selected, and its configuration looks a lot like the core block placement UI. The only difference here is that when the \"Include blocks from block layout\" box is checked, you are only placing the blocks you want to add in addition to an already existing block layout. If you uncheck the box, you are creating an entirely new block layout from scratch, and will have to replace basic things like breadcrumbs and menus. Here you can see we've added only the members block to this block layout. If we go and navigate to a collection, you'll see its list of members underneath its content. If we edit the collection and change its model tag from \"Collection\" to anything else, you'll see the block disappears! As you can see, block placement can be very flexible, and allow you to customize your site in a very granular fashion. Between using core block placement and the context module, there's no block you can't get into the right place on your site.

Collections and Deleting Collections and their members are independent of each other, and removing something from a collection does not delete it. Similarly, deleting a collection does not delete its members. Creating a Collection \u00b6 When logged in as an administrator, click the Content button under the Manage tab. Click on Add content . Then click on 'Repository Item' to give your collection the default metadata profile for Islandora 8. Fill out the form. Near the end of the form, under System, select Collection from the Model dropdown list. Click Save when done. The collection has been created. Now let's add some members to this collection. Add Existing Items to a Collection \u00b6 To populate a collection with existing items, return to any existing content and click on its Edit tab. This brings up the form for this item. Scroll down to the bottom and the System section. In the Member of section, start typing in the name of the collection this item should belong to. Select the name of the collection you want from the autocomplete. The correct collection is now selected. Click Save when ready. To confirm, return to the collection and verify the new item appears in the collection's 'Members' block. Add a New Item as a Member of a Collection \u00b6 To create an item and add it as a member to a collection in one step, visit a collection and click on its Members tab. From the Members tab, you can manage the members of a collection and perform actions on them. Click on the +Add member button, and then select 'Repository Item' to give your new item a Content Type. Only content types that have the field_member_of field will be available from this list. You are taken to the creation form for a Repository Item, but if you scroll down to the System section, you should see the widget for 'Member Of' is already filled out for you with the appropriate collection. Click 'Save' at the end of the form to create the new item and add it as a member of the collection.

It enables the use of Ajax with search blocks, facets, and search results. Requirements \u00b6 Use composer to download the required libraries and modules. composer require drupal/facets \"^1.3\" composer require drupal/search_api_solr \"^4.1\" composer require drupal/search_api \"^1.5\" However, for reference, islandora_advanced_search requires the following drupal modules: facets search_api_solr Installation \u00b6 To download/enable just this module, use the following from the command line: composer require islandora/islandora drush en islandora_advanced_search Configuration \u00b6 You can set the following configuration at Administration >> Configuration >> Advanced Search Settings (admin/config/islandora/advanced_search): Configuring Solr \u00b6 Please review Configure Search before continuing. The following assumes you already have a working Solr and the Drupal Search API setup. Configure Collection Search \u00b6 To support collection based searches you need to index the field_member_of for every repository item as well define a new field that captures the full hierarchy of field_member_of for each repository item. Add a new Content solr field field_descendant_of to the solr index at admin/config/search/search-api/index/default_solr_index/fields . Then under admin/config/search/search-api/index/default_solr_index/processors enable Index hierarchy and setup the new field to index the hierarchy. The field can now be used limit a search to all the descendants of a given object. Re-Indexing You may have to re-index to make sure the field is populated. Configure Views \u00b6 The configuration of views is outside of the scope of this document, please read the Drupal Documentation , as well as the Search API Documentation . Collection Search \u00b6 It will be typical that you require the following Relationships and Contextual Filters when setting up a search view to enable Collection Search searches. Here a relationship is setup with Member Of field and we have two contextual filters: field_member_of (Direct descendants of the Entity) field_descendant_of (All descendants of the Entity) Both of these filters are configured the exact same way. These filters are toggled by the Advanced Search block to allow the search to include all descendants or just direct descendants ( documented below ). Paging \u00b6 The paging options specified here can have an affect on the pager block ( documented below ). Sorting \u00b6 Additional the fields listed as Sort Criteria as Exposed will be made available in the pager block ( documented below ). Configure Facets \u00b6 The facets can be configured at admin/config/search/facets . Facets are linked to a Source which is a Search API View Display so it will be typically to have to duplicate your configuration for a given facet across each of the displays where you want it to show up. Include / Exclude Facets \u00b6 To be able to display exclude facet links as well as include links in the facets block we have to duplicate the configuration for the facet like so. Both the include / exclude facets must use the widget List of links that allow the user to include / exclude facets The excluded facet also needs the following settings to appear and function correctly. The URL alias must match the same value as the include facet except it must be prefixed with ~ character that is what links to the two facets to each other. And it must also explicitly be set to exclude: You may also want to enable Hide active items and Hide non-narrowing results for a cleaner presentation of facets. Configure Blocks \u00b6 For each block type: Facet Pager Advanced Search There will be one block per View Display . The block should be limited to only appear when the view it was derived from is also being displayed on the same page. This requires configuring the visibility of the block as appropriate. For collection based searches be sure to limit the display of the Facets block to the models you want to display the search on, e.g: Advanced Search Block \u00b6 For any valid search field, you can drag / drop and reorder the fields to display in the advanced search form on. The configuration resides on the block so this can differ across views / displays if need be. Additionally if the View the block was derived from has multiple contextual filters you can choose which one corresponds to direct children, this will enable the recursive search checkbox.","title":"Configure Advanced Search"},{"location":"user-documentation/advanced-search/#islandora-advanced-search","text":"Introduction Requirements Installation Configuration Configuring Solr Configure Collection Search Configure Views Collection Search Paging Sorting Configure Facets Include / Exclude Facets Configure Blocks Advanced Search Block","title":"Islandora Advanced Search"},{"location":"user-documentation/advanced-search/#introduction","text":"Advanced Search adds additional functionality beyond the basic Solr search .

For more information about Content Types in general, please see Content Types in Drupal 8 . If you are already familiar with Drupal Field UI, you\u2019re already well equipped to create and modify your own ingest forms in Islandora 8. This page will address how to create and modify ingest forms by editing fields and form display settings on Content Types via the graphical user interface (GUI). This page will also cover editing the RDF mapping to accommodate changes to fields. Islandora 8 forms are Drupal forms, and for help working with forms via the API, please check out the Further Reading section for links to more advanced Drupal documentation. Before you start \u00b6 The following How-To assumes that you are using the (optional) Islandora Defaults configuration. This configuration is deployed automatically if you build your Islandora site using the Ansible Playbook , ISLE with Docker-Compose , or are using the sandbox or a Virtual Machine Image This How-To assumes familiarity with Drupal terms such as Node , Content Type , and Media . How to Modify a Content Type \u00b6 If you have deployed your Islandora 8 with the Islandora Defaults configuration, you will already have a Repository Item content type available, with pre-configured fields and repository behaviours. In the Admin menu, go to Structure >> Content Types and find the Repository Item content type. Select Manage Fields . There are multiple tabs with different options to configure your Content Type: Manage Fields : A list of the fields available in this form. This is where you can add new fields and make adjustments to existing fields, such as whether the field has access restrictions or is required. Manage form display : Set the order in which fields appear in a form, including nesting; set how the user will enter data into a field (i.e., text field, drop-down list, radio buttons, etc); set fields to be hidden in the form. Manage display : Set how the data stored in the fields will be displayed on the Node. Custom display settings can be set for different \"view modes.\" For instance, a different view mode is applied for items using the Openseadragon viewer, which includes a field that displays the Media in Openseadragon instead of the standard Drupal image viewer. Changes not displaying? If you make changes under Manage display and don't see them reflected in your Node, double check that you have edited the right view mode Devel : This tab is generated by an optional module that is useful for development and troubleshooting; it can be ignored in this How-To. For more information, see Devel . Add a Field \u00b6 This example adds a new field where a user can indicate if the repository item needs to be reviewed: Click Add Field In some cases an existing field may be available to use instead of creating a new one. The dropdown box labeled Re-use an existing field has a list of available fields. For this example we will create a brand-new field. Since the example field is a \u201cyes/no\u201d decision (whether the item needs review or not), choose \"Boolean\" from the dropdown menu and give the Label field a name. See the list of Drupal 8 FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters for descriptions of the different types available by default. Additional modules, such as the controlled_access_terms module, can provide their own Field types to choose from as well. Click Save and continue. Next, configure how the field is stored in the Drupal database. For this field type you can select how many values will be allowed. The default settings, \"Limited\" in the dropdown box and \"1\" for the allowed number of values works for our example. Click Save field settings. Configure how the field is described (including its display label and the help text for when it appears on a form) and constraints on its use. In this screenshot, the field will be required for this Content Type, and will be set to \u201con\u201d by default. In the Default Value section, click the checkbox next to Needs Review to indicate all new repository items need review by default. Click Save settings. The new field has been added: It appears in the ingest form when creating a new repository object. To test this, go to Content >> Add content >> Repository item : RDF Mappings New fields, with the exception of Typed Relation fields, are not automatically indexed in Fedora and the triple-store. Update the Content Type's RDF Mapping to enable indexing the field (see below). Search New fields will not automatically be searchable. They need to be added to the Solr index configuration. See the 'Setup and Configure Search' page for more information. Context To add new behavior based on the results of this new field, check out Context . Change the Form Display \u00b6 To change where in the form a field is displayed, go to the Admin menu, return to Structure >> Content Types , and find the Repository Item content type again. Select Manage form display from the dropdown menu or select the Manage form display tab. All of the fields in this content type are available, in a list, with a simple drag-and-place UI. Drag the new field to the top of the form. You can also change the way the Boolean options are displayed, with radio buttons as opposed to a single checkbox. Different display options will be available from the dropdown menu depending on field type. For more information, please check out List of Drupal 8 FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters Click Save . When creating a new Repository Item, the new field appears at the top, as a set of radio buttons. Change the Content Display \u00b6 Finally, change how the results of this example field are displayed. Initially the new field shows up at the bottom of repository object pages: In the Admin menu, return to Structure >> Content Types and find the Repository Item content type again. Select Manage display from the dropdown menu or select the Manage display tab. Find the new field. You can change how the field title or label is displayed. Click the dropdown menu to choose from inline/above/hidden/visually hidden. You can also replace the options displayed with variations on a binary choice. Click the gear to choose from the following: On/Off , Yes/No , Enabled/Disabled , 1/0 , checkmark/X , or hide the field completely. You can also drag the field into the Disabled section so that neither its label or its contents appear in the display, although the field is saved on the Node. Drag the field to \"Disabled\" and save. The contents of the field are no longer displayed on the Node, but it is available when editing the node. Create a Content Type \u00b6 To create your own custom content type from scratch, please refer to this guide on Drupal.org. Custom content types are not synced to Fedora or indexed by the triple-store by default. Repository managers must add them to a context that instructs Drupal to perform these synchronizations. In Islandora Defaults, the \"Content\" ('repository_content') context does this. To add a new content type to that context: Navigate to the Contexts configuration page ('/admin/structure/context'). Find the Content context and click the corresponding Edit button ('/admin/structure/context/repository_content'). Find the Node Bundle condition in the Conditions section. Click the checkbox for the new Content Type. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Save and continue . Updating contexts does not retroactively fire any actions. Any of the custom content type's nodes that were created before updating the context will need to have the indexing action manually triggered. Update / Create an RDF Mapping \u00b6 RDF mapping aligns Drupal fields with RDF ontology properties. For example, the title field of a content model can be mapped to dcterms:title and/or schema:title . In Islandora 8, triples expressed by these mappings get synced to Fedora and indexed in the Blazegraph triplestore. RDF mappings are defined/stored in Drupal as a YAML file (to learn more about YAML, there are several tutorials on the web . Currently, Drupal 8 does not have a UI to create/update RDF mappings to ontologies other than Schema.org. This requires repository managers to update the configuration files themselves. Consider using the RDF mappings included in islandora_defaults as templates by copying and modifying one to meet your needs. The Drupal 8 Configuration Synchronization export (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export ) and import (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import ) can be used to get a copy of the mappings for editing in a text editor before being uploaded again. Alternatively, a repository manager can update the configuration on the server and use Features to import the edits. An RDF mapping configuration file has two main areas: the mapping's metadata and the mapping itself. Most of the mapping's metadata should be left alone unless you are creating a brand new mapping for a new Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary. A partial example from islandora_default's islandora_object (Repository Item) is included below: langcode: en status: true dependencies: config: - node.type.islandora_object enforced: module: - islandora_demo module: - node id: node.islandora_object targetEntityType: node bundle: islandora_object types: - 'pcdm:Object' fieldMappings: title: properties: - 'dc:title' field_alternative_title: properties: - 'dc:alternative' field_edtf_date: properties: - 'dc:date' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_description: properties: - 'dc:description' The required mapping metadata fields when creating a brand-new mapping include the id , status , targetEntityType , and bundle . ( uuid and _core , not seen in the example above but may be present in exported copies, will be added by Drupal automatically.) bundle is the machine name for the Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary you are creating the mapping for. targetEntityType is node for Content Types or taxonomy_term for Taxonomy Vocabularies. The id configuration is a concatenation of target entity type and bundle ('node' and 'islandora_object' in the example above). The id is also used to name the configuration file: e.g. rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml is rdf.mapping. plus the id ( node.islandora_object ) and then .yml . The mapping itself consists of the types ' and fieldMappings configurations. All the mappings use RDF namespaces instead of fully-qualified URIs. For example, the type for islandora_object is pcdm:Object instead of http://pcdm.org/models#Object . Unfortunately, the available namespaces are defined in module hooks (hook_rdf_namespaces) rather than in a configuration file. Repository managers wanting to add additional namespaces need to create their own module and implement hook_rdf_namespaces. See the islandora_defaults hook implementation for an example. Namespaces currently supported (ordered by the module that supplies them) include: rdf content: http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/ dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ og: http://ogp.me/ns# rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# schema: http://schema.org/ sioc: http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns# sioct: http://rdfs.org/sioc/types# skos: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# islandora ldp: http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp# dc11: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ nfo: http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo/v1.1/ ebucore: http://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore# fedora: http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository# owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl# ore: http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/ rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# islandora: http://islandora.ca pcdm: http://pcdm.org/models# use: http://pcdm.org/use# iana: http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/ islandora_demo relators: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/ controlled_access_terms wgs84_pos: http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos# org: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org: xs: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# The types corresponds to the rdf:type predicate (which corresponds to JSON-LD's @type ) and can have multiple values. This type value will be applied to every node or taxonomy term using the mapped content type or vocabulary. In some cases a repository may want a node or taxonomy term's rdf:type to be configurable. For example, the Corporate Body Vocabulary (provided by the Controlled Access Terms Default Configuration module) has schema:Organization set as the default type in the RDF mapping. However, more granular types may apply to one organization and not another, such as schema:GovernmentOrganization or schema:Corporation . The alter_jsonld_type Context reaction allows Content Types and Taxonomy Vocabularies to add a field's values as rdf:types to its JSON-LD serialization (the format used to index a node or taxonomy term in Fedora and the triple-store). fieldMappings specifies the fields to be included, their RDF property mappings, and any necessary data converters (the datatype_callback ). One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property by adding them to the field's properties list. The datatype_callback is defined by the 'callable' key and the fully qualified static method used to convert it to the desired data format. For example, fields of the Drupal datetime type need to be converted to ISO 8601 values, so we use the Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value function to perform the conversion.

For example, the title field of a content model can be mapped to dcterms:title and/or schema:title . In Islandora 8, triples expressed by these mappings get synced to Fedora and indexed in the Blazegraph triplestore. RDF mappings are defined/stored in Drupal as a YAML file (to learn more about YAML, there are several tutorials on the web . Currently, Drupal 8 does not have a UI to create/update RDF mappings to ontologies other than Schema.org. This requires repository managers to update the configuration files themselves. Consider using the RDF mappings included in islandora_defaults as templates by copying and modifying one to meet your needs. The Drupal 8 Configuration Synchronization export (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export ) and import (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import ) can be used to get a copy of the mappings for editing in a text editor before being uploaded again. Alternatively, a repository manager can update the configuration on the server and use Features to import the edits. An RDF mapping configuration file has two main areas: the mapping's metadata and the mapping itself. Most of the mapping's metadata should be left alone unless you are creating a brand new mapping for a new Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary. A partial example from islandora_default's islandora_object (Repository Item) is included below: langcode: en status: true dependencies: config: - node.type.islandora_object enforced: module: - islandora_demo module: - node id: node.islandora_object targetEntityType: node bundle: islandora_object types: - 'pcdm:Object' fieldMappings: title: properties: - 'dc:title' field_alternative_title: properties: - 'dc:alternative' field_edtf_date: properties: - 'dc:date' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_description: properties: - 'dc:description' The required mapping metadata fields when creating a brand-new mapping include the id , status , targetEntityType , and bundle . ( uuid and _core , not seen in the example above but may be present in exported copies, will be added by Drupal automatically.) bundle is the machine name for the Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary you are creating the mapping for. targetEntityType is node for Content Types or taxonomy_term for Taxonomy Vocabularies. The id configuration is a concatenation of target entity type and bundle ('node' and 'islandora_object' in the example above). The id is also used to name the configuration file: e.g. rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml is rdf.mapping. plus the id ( node.islandora_object ) and then .yml . The mapping itself consists of the types ' and fieldMappings configurations. All the mappings use RDF namespaces instead of fully-qualified URIs. For example, the type for islandora_object is pcdm:Object instead of http://pcdm.org/models#Object . Unfortunately, the available namespaces are defined in module hooks (hook_rdf_namespaces) rather than in a configuration file. Repository managers wanting to add additional namespaces need to create their own module and implement hook_rdf_namespaces. See the islandora_defaults hook implementation for an example. Namespaces currently supported (ordered by the module that supplies them) include: rdf content: http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/ dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ og: http://ogp.me/ns# rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# schema: http://schema.org/ sioc: http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns# sioct: http://rdfs.org/sioc/types# skos: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# islandora ldp: http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp# dc11: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ nfo: http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo/v1.1/ ebucore: http://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore# fedora: http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository# owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl# ore: http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/ rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# islandora: http://islandora.ca pcdm: http://pcdm.org/models# use: http://pcdm.org/use# iana: http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/ islandora_demo relators: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/ controlled_access_terms wgs84_pos: http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos# org: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org: xs: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# The types corresponds to the rdf:type predicate (which corresponds to JSON-LD's @type ) and can have multiple values. This type value will be applied to every node or taxonomy term using the mapped content type or vocabulary. In some cases a repository may want a node or taxonomy term's rdf:type to be configurable. For example, the Corporate Body Vocabulary (provided by the Controlled Access Terms Default Configuration module) has schema:Organization set as the default type in the RDF mapping. However, more granular types may apply to one organization and not another, such as schema:GovernmentOrganization or schema:Corporation . The alter_jsonld_type Context reaction allows Content Types and Taxonomy Vocabularies to add a field's values as rdf:types to its JSON-LD serialization (the format used to index a node or taxonomy term in Fedora and the triple-store). fieldMappings specifies the fields to be included, their RDF property mappings, and any necessary data converters (the datatype_callback ). One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property by adding them to the field's properties list. The datatype_callback is defined by the 'callable' key and the fully qualified static method used to convert it to the desired data format. For example, fields of the Drupal datetime type need to be converted to ISO 8601 values, so we use the Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value function to perform the conversion.

Context defines \"conditions\" and \"reactions\" to enact the \"if this [condition], then that [reaction]\" logic. Some Islandora 7.x repositories use the community-contributed Islandora Context module to apply this sort of logic to Islandora objects. An example Context from Islandora 7.x is If an object's namespace is 'customnamespace', render the block containing the rights statement \"Please contact Special Collections before reusing this item\". The Context project page on drupal.org says \"You can think of each context as representing a 'section' of your site\", but that doesn't tell the whole story, since it gives the impression that Context is all about defining subsites. Context in Drupal 8 is much more powerful than in Drupal 7 due to how it interacts with the rest of Drupal (specifically, through Drupal 8's new plugin API). Because of this increased flexibility and power, and because Context provides a ready-made user interface for site administrators to combine conditions and reactions, Islandora 8 uses Context to drive the logic underlying many important aspects of Islandora, including which derivatives get generated and how objects are displayed. In Islandora 7, many of these things are managed (and often hard-coded) within solution packs and utility modules. An Example \u00b6 Let's look at the example of how Context can determine how an object is displayed. Drupal 8 has the idea of \"view modes\", which allow site builders to choose what happens when an object is viewed by the user (it has nothing to do with Drupal Views). In the node edit form for Islandora objects, there is a checkbox that, if checked, tells Drupal to render the image using the OpenSeadragon viewer: This functionality is accomplished via the \"Open Seadragon\" Context, which, as its configuration suggests, checks as its condition whether the node as the \"Open Seadragon\" tag and if so, reacts by using the view mode \"Open Seadragon\": Context and Actions \u00b6 Context in Drupal 8 uses Drupal Actions to execute the \"then that\" part of their logic. An implication of this is some configuration options relevant to the outcome of the \"then that\" reaction are configured in the Action admin interface (located at admin/config/system/actions ), not within the Context admin interface (located at admin/structure/context ). While this makes for a clunky admin experience, the advantage is that it allows the reuse of a single piece of Drupal code in multiple Contexts. One important group of functionality in Islandora 8 repositories that admins might want to control is what types of media get persisted to Fedora. Islandora 8 allows administrators to choose what types of media get persisted to Fedora and what types of media get persisted to the Drupal public file system. For example, you may want to persist your thumbnails to Fedora along with your \"Preservation Master\" and \"Original File\" files. This can be accomplished using Context. By default Islandora 8 stores thumbnails in Drupal's public file system, not in Fedora. Thumbnails are automatically generated by a Context (the \"Image Service File\" Context to be specific), but if you want to change the file system where your thumbnails are stored to the be Fedora file system, you need to change that setting in the \"Image - Generate a thumbnail from a service file\" Action, not in the Context that uses that action: This configuration should be done as part of your initial Islandora 8 setup, since there is currently no way to move thumbnails that were persisted to Drupal's public file system to Fedora, or vice versa. But, at least site admins can choose one or the other using this Action. You can create custom Actions and then use them in Contexts. For example, if you want to present a message to the user every time they upload a media tagged as \"Preservation Master File\", create an Action of type \"Display a message to the user\" and enter your message: Then, create a Context that uses this Action as its Reaction, and as its Condition, uses \"Media has term\" with a value of \"Preservation Master File\": Now, when a user creates a Media and tags it as a \"Preservation Master File\", they will be shown the message you created in your Action: Tips on Using Islandora-specific Contexts \u00b6 Islandora provides some Conditions and Reactions that aren't available on other Drupal sites. When using them, you may find the following tips useful: When using the \"Node has term with URI\", \"Media has term with URI\", and \"Parent node for media has term with URI\" Islandora-specific Conditions, you may want to enter multiple terms to take advantage of the AND/OR logic they provide. To do so, add a comma ( , ) after the first term in the autocomplete field and continue typing. These three Conditions limit taxonomy terms that show up in their autocomplete Term field to terms that have URIs associated with them, for example from the Islandora Media Use or Islandora Models vocabularies (although any term that has a URI will appear). If you want to configure Conditions using terms that do not have a URI, you can use the contrib Term Condition module . Be as specific as possible in configuring your Conditions. If your Conditions seem to apply too broadly or in unexpected ways, try adding a \"Content Entity Type\" Condition to limit the Context to pages that render Islandora objects or media. Increased Flexibility \u00b6 Most Islandora 8 repository administrators will not need to alter or configure any Contexts. But since much of Islandora 8's underlying functionality is governed by this powerful Drupal contrib module, administrators should become comfortable using it, and Actions, to customize and refine their repositories.

The field formatter will work with specific types of Drupal fields (e.g. file fields or image fields, some may even provide their own fields). Viewers that are known to work with Islandora 8 include: OpenSeadragon , via the Drupal module OpenSeadragon (maintained by the Islandora Foundation). pdf.js , via the Drupal contrib module PDF Both are included with Islandora Defaults. How are viewers configured? \u00b6 In the generic Islandora 8 content modelling scenario, we often want the viewer to appear on a \"resource node\" when the file itself is in a field on a Media that references that node. These layers of indirection make displaying viewers on nodes rather complex. Example - Open Seadragon (in Islandora Defaults) \u00b6 Here is how viewers are implemented in Islandora Defaults. This example uses OpenSeadragon, but pdf.js is configured with the same method. This method was chosen because it uses pure configuration and no extra code. It relies on users tagging nodes with appropriate \"display hint\" terms to trigger Contexts to switch the node's display mode to one that includes an EVA field, which renders the appropriate Media in a way that shows the desired file in the viewer. Expected behaviour for this scenario: \u00b6 Create a Repository Item, and tag it with \"Open Seadragon\" (under Display Hints). Add a Media of type \"File\" to that node, upload a file such as a tiff or jpeg-2000, and tag it with \"Original File\" (under Media Use). Save and publish the Media. Go to the Repository Item's page, and you should see your file displayed in the viewer. Components of this scenario: \u00b6 A viewer that includes a field formatter (e.g. the module OpenSeadragon) A media display mode (e.g. the media display mode \"Open Seadragon\") A media type (File, though Image is configured similarly) A file field on that media type that can use that field formatter (e.g. field_media_file) A field on that media type that points to a parent node (e.g. field_media_of) Display Mode Configuration (make that display mode, on that media type, show only the file field rendered through that viewer's field formatter. e.g. see Media Types > File > Manage Display > Open Seadragon) An EVA view (which shows a node's attached media as rendered by that Media display mode. e.g. the view \"OpenSeadragon Media EVAs\") A content display mode (e.g. the node display mode called \"Open Seadragon\") A content type (e.g. Repository Item) Display Mode Configuration (make that display mode, on that content type, display that EVA as well as whatever metadata is relevant - see Content Types > Repository Item > Manage Display > Open Seadragon ) A taxonomy term with a URI (e.g. \"Open Seadragon\" (http://openseadragon.github.io) imported by a migration in Islandora Defaults) A field on that content type that can have that taxonomy term (e.g. the \"Display Hints\" field on Repository Item) A context (which says if a node has that term, then change to the display mode. See the context \"Open Seadragon\") Logic: \u00b6 If a node has the right term then a context is triggered so the node gets shown in a custom display mode which you configured for that content type to include a custom EVA View \"field\" which displays the node's attached media rendered in a custom media display mode which for that media type is configured to display nothing but the file in a viewer. Relevant files: \u00b6 Islandora Defaults is a Feature, and the following YAML files in islandora_defaults/config/install contain configuration items that are loaded when the feature is enabled. Changes to these files will not affect the live site configuration, and changes to the live site configuration will not be reflected in these files. Filename Comments core.entity_view_mode.node.open_seadragon.yml (a media display mode) defines the Open Seadragon display mode as an option for any Media media.type.file.yml (a media type) define File media, or in this case, re-define an existing type provided by Core. This feature will override the core settings. field.field.media.file.field_media_file.yml (a field that can use the viewer) Defines a file field on File media called field_media_file, or in this case, re-defines it because it was already part of core. Usually you need a field.storage too but it was already defined in core and is not overridden here. field.field.media.file.field_media_of.yml (a field that points to a parent node) attach the the \"Media Of\" field to File media. In this case again, the field storage is not present because it was defined in Islandora Core Feature. core.entity_view_display.media.file.open_seadragon.yml (view mode configuration) configures the Open Seadragon display mode for File media, so it shows only the field_media_file using the Open Seadragon field formatter. views.view.openseadragon_media_evas.yml (an EVA View) defines a view that shows a Media that is \"Media Of\" the current node (from URL) and is published and has \"Media Use\" = Original File. (there are two other EVAs defined by this view that use Preservation Master and Service File respectively.) core.entity_view_mode.node.open_seadragon.yml (a content display mode) defines the Open Seadragon display mode as an option for any Node node.type.islandora_object.yml (a content type) defines the Repository Item content type core.entity_view_display.node.islandora_object.open_seadragon.yml (view mode configuration) configures the Open Seadragon display mode for Repository Item, so it shows the Open Seadragon EVA for Original File as well as normal metadata taxonomy.vocabulary.islandora_display.yml (taxonomy vocabulary) define a vocabulary to hold display hints migrate_plus.migration.islandora_defaults_tags.yml (migration) create a term in that vocabulary for \"Open Seadragon.\" Taxonomy terms are \"content\" so must be entered through a migration. field.storage.node.field_display_hints.yml (field storage for display hints) defines the display hints field as an option for any node field.field.node.islandora_object.field_display_hints.yml (field for display hints) configures the display hints field on Repository Item context.context.open_seadragon.yml (a context) tells nodes with term \"Open Seadragon\" to use display mode \"Open Seadragon\" Improvements \u00b6 This is awfully complex.

When comparing new Islandora and Fedora to older versions it may also be helpful to reference the Islandora 7 Glossary . Alpaca \u00b6 Event-driven middleware based on Apache Camel that synchronizes a Fedora repository with a Drupal instance. CLAW \u00b6 CLAW (CLAW Linked Asset WebDataFrameWork) was the development code name for the software released in June, 2019 as Islandora 8 . Collection \u00b6 A collection is a way of grouping related resources together, much like a directory on a computer. Collections can \u201ccontain\u201d any number of related resource nodes and sub-collections. Crayfish \u00b6 A collection of Islandora 8 microservices . Some of the microservices are built specifically for use with a Fedora Repository and API-X, while others are just for general use within Islandora 8. Derivative \u00b6 A version of a file which is derived from an uploaded file. For example, a thumbnail generated from an uploaded image. Islandora uses microservices to generate derivatives. Docker \u00b6 Docker is a platform that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Islandora uses Docker as part of ISLE, a suite of Docker containers that run the various components of Islandora required by Islandora Defaults. Drupal \u00b6 Drupal is an open source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. Known for being extremely flexible and extensible, Drupal is supported by a community of over 630,000 users and developers. Drupal sites can be customized and themed in a wide variety of ways. Drupal functions as the front-end of Islandora. Drupal Core \u00b6 The files, themes, profiles, and modules included with the standard project software download. Drupal Roles \u00b6 Roles are a way of assigning specific permissions to a group of users. Any user assigned to a role will have the same permissions as all other users assigned to that role. This allows you to control which users have permission to view, edit, or delete content in Drupal. Islandora provides a special role called fedoraAdmin that is required to have actions in Drupal reflected in Fedora. Entity \u00b6 A Drupal term for an item of either content or configuration data, although in common usage, the term often refers to content entities. Examples include content items, custom blocks, taxonomy terms, and definitions of content types; the first three are content entities, and the last is a configuration entity. Fedora (Repository Software) \u00b6 Fedora is a digital asset management architecture upon which institutional repositories, digital archives, and digital library systems might be built. Fedora is the underlying architecture for a digital repository, and is not a complete management, indexing, discovery, and delivery application. The Fedora repository functions as the standard smart storage for Islandora. Field \u00b6 Data of a certain type that is attached to a content entity. For instance, on a Resource Node content type, you might have fields for a title, description, display hints, subjects, and other metadata. Flysystem \u00b6 Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP. Islandora uses Flysystem to swap about different backend filesystem applications. Islandora provides a custom Flysystem adapter for Fedora. IIIF \u00b6 The International Image Interoperability Framework . A set of open standards that help archives, libraries, and museums make the most of their digitized collections with deep zoom, annotation capabilities, and more, and also the community of users and developers that suport the framework. Ingest \u00b6 To ingest an object is to add an entry for it in Islandora. This is done primarily through the Drupal interface. The word 'ingest' is used in repository language because repository software, rather than having an object and associated components forced upon it, takes in and processes the object itself, creating derivatives automatically. Often, when referring to the process of ingesting objects, Islandora and its associated documentation use other terms such as 'import' or 'add resource node'. In such contexts, these terms generally refer to the ingest process. ISLE \u00b6 ISLE, or ISLandora Enterprise, is a community initiative to ease the installation and maintenance of Islandora by using Docker . Media \u00b6 A drop-in replacement for the Drupal core upload field with a unified User Interface where editors and administrators can upload, manage, and reuse files and multimedia assets. Microservice \u00b6 A software development technique \u2014 a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style \u2014 that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. Module \u00b6 Software (usually PHP, JavaScript, and/or CSS) that extends site features and adds functionality. Drupal modules conform to a specific structure allowing them to integrate with the Drupal architecture. Node \u00b6 A node is any piece of individual content, such as a page, article, forum topic, or a blog entry. All content on a Drupal website is stored and treated as \"nodes\". For information about nodes specific to Islandora, see \"Resource Node.\" Open Source \u00b6 Open source describes a method of software development that promotes access to the end product's source code. Islandora is an open source product with an active development community, operating under the GPL license (2.0) for Drupal components and the MIT license for non-Drupal components. Resource Node \u00b6 A resource node is a Drupal node that represents a single conceptual item or object stored in an Islandora repository. It acts as a container for all files and metadata associated with that item, and is the place where the item 'lives' as a visitable url. For example, A video stored in Islandora will have a resource node, which metadata stored in fields, a preservation master file, and may have a thumbnail, web-friendly derivatives, and technical metadata associated with the resource node. The resource node may also belong to one or more collections. Taxonomy term \u00b6 A term used to classify content, such as a tag or a category. Theme \u00b6 Software and asset files (images, CSS, PHP code, and/or templates) that determine the style and layout of the site. The Drupal project distinguishes between core and contributed themes. View \u00b6 A database query used to generate lists or tables of content. Drupal provides a powerful administrator interface for creating and editing views without any coding. Viewer \u00b6 A \"Viewer\" is an add-on package that allows a solution pack to embed, display, or playback a particular object in a web accessible format. Viewers are typically a combination of a Drupal Library and a Drupal Module. The Drupal Library is the package of code that represents the player or display mechanism, and the Drupal Module is the code package that allows the Drupal Library to be accessed from within the Drupal environment. Virtual Machine Image \u00b6 The Virtual Machine Image allows you to mount a fully working version of Islandora on your local machine as a separate virtual machine.

What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section \"Looking under the hood (and beyond)\" below.

To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of \"Paged Content\" or \"Publication Issue\". Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the \"Node has term\" condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above. You can change how the paged content thumbnails are arranged in the OpenSeadragon viewport by doing the following: Visit admin/config/media/openseadragon Scroll to the bottom, where you will see the \"Collection Mode\" options. The \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox will be unchecked. This is normal (unless you have already checked it). The Openseadragon Context automatically, and temporarily, puts OpenSeadragon in Collection mode when rendering a Paged Content object and then puts it back to Sequence mode (which is what mode it's in when the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox is unchecked). This means that in order for you to change options that apply to Collection Mode, you will need to check the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox, change its options, save the form, then uncheck the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox again. Just follow these steps, and it will work! Check the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox. The Collection Mode options will appear. Adjust the options to what you want.

Drupal uses a media's fields to store information about the media's file, such as file size, width and height (for images), alt text (for images), creation date, and so on. Compared to Islandora 7 In Islandora 7, this sort of technical metadata would have been stored as datastream properties or as additional metadata-specific datastreams. In Islandora 8, each datastream holds its technical metadata using an associated media entity. Fedora will store the media's file as a binary resource and use the media's properties as the binary resource's description. For example, creating a media with a file named test.jpg (in November 2019) will create a Fedora binary resource of the file accessible at /fcrepo/rest/2019-11/test.jpg with the media's fields accessible at /fcrepo/rest/2019-11/test.jpg/fcr:metadata . Media types \u00b6 Islandora Defaults makes use of the media types provided automatically by Drupal. The file extensions allowed by each media type have been configured at the Drupal level. It is possible to create your own media types, and/or to edit the allowed field types and functionality of the existing media types. However, with Islandora Defaults, the Image media type only allows .png, .gif, .jpg or .jpeg files. Tiffs (.tiff files) must be added in the File media type instead of Image . Media revisions \u00b6 The metadata associated with a file can be updated by clicking the Edit tab while on the media's page and clicking Save . The Create new revision checkbox is selected by default which will prompt Fedora to make a new version of the media's metadata before updating its resource record. A message can be added to the revision which is stored in Drupal but is not currently saved in Fedora. Using the Media form to replace an existing file does not behave as expected. \u00b6 The media edit form allows a user to remove a file and replace it with a new one. However, because of the relationship Islandora creates between a file and its media, the effects of removing a file and uploading a new one are not intuitive. First, the remove button removes the file's reference on the media but does not delete the file, which, if in Fedora, will remain in Fedora. Second, because Drupal does not want users to reuse a file path uploading a file, even with the same name in the same month, Drupal will rename the file for you. This will result in a new binary resource in Fedora, rather than replacing the existing resource, so the file's URI in Fedora will change Third, the metadata synced from the Media into Fedora at [old Fedora URI]/fcr:metadata will remain in Fedora, but the metadata in the Media will also be synced into Fedora at [new Fedora URI]/fcr:metadata. There will be no way for the metadata in Fedora describing the file at the old Fedora URI to be edited. Removing Media with Actions To completely delete a file and its metadata from Fedora and Drupal, run the \"Delete media and file(s) action\" after selecting the Media in the general media list (/admin/content/media). This will cause the paths to the file and its metadata in Fedora to return 404s. Replacing Media via REST It is possible to use Islandora's REST interface to replace Media and Files. Media Ownership \u00b6 Islandora 8 objects can have any number of media associated with them. Media store a reference to the resource node they belong to using a special field, \"Media Of\". By changing this field's value, you can change which resource node owns the media, and therefore, where it gets displayed or managed. Compared to Islandora 7 The direction of the relationship between objects and datastreams is reversed when compared to Islandora 7. Generally speaking, objects are unaware of their datastreams, and it's a Drupal view that lists datastreams for an object. Media Use \u00b6 Islandora 8 media express their intended use with a special \"Media Use\" field, which accepts taxonomy terms from the \"Media Usage\" vocabulary. Because the Media Usage vocabulary is an ordinary Drupal vocabulary, Islandora 8 site administrators can create additional terms, and in turn, these local terms can be used to identify media that have some custom local purpose. However, most of the default set of \"Media Use\" terms are taken from the PCDM Use Extension vocabulary: Compared to Islandora 7 Terms from the Media Usage vocabulary are very similar to DSIDs in Islandora 7. The only difference is that a DSID is immutable, but a media's usage can be changed at any time through the media's edit form. Derivatives \u00b6 Islandora generates derivatives based on the Media Use term selected for a Media and the Model of the node that owns it. All of this is configurable using Context. By default, derivatives are generated from Media with the \"Original Files\" term selected. When an Original File is uploaded, if the node that owns it has an \"Image\" model, image derivatives are created. If it's a \"Video\", then video derivatives are generated, etc... By default, derivatives are created with a path determined by the current year, current month, the associated resource node' identifier assigned by Drupal, and the type of derivative. For example, a resource node found at node/2 with a service file media generated in October 2019 will have the path \"2019-10/2-Service File.jpg\". Naming conventions can be configured by editing each derivative action's File path settings. Within a node's media tab, you can see all of its media, including derivatives, listed along with their usage. For example, from the Original File, a lower quality \"Service File\" and a smaller \"Thumbnail Image\" file were generated. For more information on how to configure derivatives, see the section on Context . Multi-File Media \u00b6 An alternate method of using Media to store files and derivatives is known as \"multi-file\" or multifile media. This method allows a single resource node to have multiple \"Original Files\" or \"Preservation Masters\". This method was implemented by UPEI's Research Data Management project , to represent datasets that may include multiple important files that require equal preservation treatment and derivatives (such as a spreadsheet and accompanying data dictionary), while being described by a single set of descriptive metadata. There are no multi-file media bundles that currently ship with Islandora. The following recipe describes how to set up multi-file media: On an existing or new Media bundle that already has a main storage field (e.g. field_media_image or field_media_audio_file), add additional fields to hold derivatives. They need to be \"File\"-type fields. The field names should indicate the \"Media use\". Set up as many as you need, for example, Thumbnail, Service File, Extracted text, etc. Note that the \"Media Use\" field is no longer relevant for multi-file media bundles, as a single media instance of this type contains all \"Media Uses\" (e.g. derivatives) in different fields. Create a derivative Action that uses one of the two existing multi-file media base actions: \"Generate a Derivative File For Media Attachment\" or \"Generate a Derivative Image For Media Attachment\". This is where you configure which queue it goes to (which derivative-creating program runs), which field the resulting file ends up in, and potentially which additional arguments to pass to the microservice. Configure Contexts to trigger the Action to create derivatives. If using a combination of standard and multi-file media in your repository, ensure the Contexts include appropriate filtering Conditions. Add a Derivative reaction and select the Action you created in the previous step. Configure your resource node to display its (potentially multiple) files as desired. This may involve creating a view of media attached to the current node, and displaying the Service File (or Thumbnail, etc) field of the media, then setting the view block to appear on the node page.

This allows us to interact with metadata (add, edit, remove, display, index in a search engine...) almost entirely using standard Drupal processes. If exporting this metadata to Fedora and/or a triplestore, the values are serialized to RDF using mappings that can be set for each bundle. Drupal 8 Terminology In Drupal 8, Fields can be attached to bundles (sometimes called entity sub-types -- e.g. Content types, Media types, Vocabularies) or entities (e.g. Users). For more on Fields, see \"2.3 Content Entities and Fields\" and \"6.3 Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type\" in the Official Drupal Guide. As described in the resource nodes section , Islandora 8 digital objects are comprised of Drupal nodes for descriptive metadata, Drupal media for technical metadata, and Drupal files for the binary objects. This section describes how Islandora 8 uses and extends Drupal fields to manage descriptive metadata. Content Types \u00b6 In Drupal, Nodes come in different sub-types called Content Types (e.g. Article, Basic page, Repository item). Content types contain fields, and configurations for how those fields can be edited or displayed. Each content type is essentially a metadata profile that can be used for a piece of web content, or to describe a digital resource. For each field in a content type, an administrator can configure how data is entered, how it can be displayed, how many values can be stored, and how long the value can be. Some configurations, such as data entry and display, can be changed at any time. Others, such as how long a value can be or what options are available in a select list, cannot be changed once content has been created without first deleting all content of that type. However, fields can be added to existing content types with no consequence. For example, the 'islandora_defaults' module provides a Repository Item content type that defines many fields including \"Alternative Title\" and \"Date Issued\". Under the management menu for Repository Item you can see a list of the fields it includes (\"Manage fields\") as well as tabs for changing the input forms (\"Manage form display\") and display modes (\"Manage display\"). See the \" Create / Update a Content Type \" section for more details on creating and configuring fields. Titles aren't fields. Note that the \"Title\" field does not appear in this list. It is a built-in part of every content type. You can edit the label of this \"field\" if you want it called something other than \"Title\" under the \"Edit\" tab for that content type. This built-in title \"field\" is limited to 255 characters; if your content has longer titles it is encouraged to create a separate long_title field to store the full title and reserve the default title field for a display title. There is a contributed module called Node Title Length , which allows an administrator to configure the length of the title field in the core node table. However, this only works on nodes (not media or other entities) and involves meddling in a core Drupal database schema, which makes some people uneasy. 7.x Migration Note: What about my XML? In 7.x, metadata were usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values. Where some hierarchy or field grouping is necessary, this can be done in Drupal using Paragraphs , a widely-used Drupal contrib module. At the moment (Nov 2019) we are working on the technical challenge of mapping data from paragraphs into RDF in Fedora. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a default mapping ( spreadsheet , guidance document ) which provides a basic, yet customizable, transform between MODS metadata and Drupal fields in Islandora Defaults. It is suggested that individual institutions customize the mapping to meet their unique needs. That said, if keeping the \"legacy\" XML metadata from 7.x is important to you, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity. However, there is no mechanism in Islandora 8 for editing XML in a user-friendly way. When you create a node (i.e. an instantiation of a content type, such as by using Drupal's \"Add Content\" workflow), the fields defined by its content type become available. Once a node is created, its content type cannot be changed. To \"switch\" a node to a different content type, a repository manager would need to create a new node of the target content type, map the field values (programmatically or by copy-paste), and update any Media or children that refer to the old node to refer to the new one. Not all content types in your Drupal site need be Islandora \"resource nodes\". A \"resource node\" content type will likely have behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) associated with it. This configuration, and the communication to the user of which content types are and are not considered to be Islandora resource nodes is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a \"resource node\" is usually considered a descriptive record for \"a thing\", and is conceptually similar to an \"Islandora Object\" in 7.x, i.e. a \"Fedora Object\" in Fedora 3.x and below. Vocabularies \u00b6 In Drupal, Taxonomy Vocabularies (or simply Vocabularies ) are also entity sub-types that define a set of fields and their configurations. Whereas instances of content types are called nodes , items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms ). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article content type includes a field field_tags that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary. There are two ways that users can interact with taxonomies: they can be \"closed,\" e.g. a fixed list to pick from in a dropdown, or \"open,\" e.g. field_tags where users can enter new terms, which are created on the fly. This is not set on the vocabulary itself, but in the configuration of the field (typically on a node). Terms within vocabularies have an ordering, and can have hierarchical structure, but do not need to. Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the 'Islandora Models' vocabulary which includes the terms 'Audio', 'Binary', 'Collection', 'Digital Document', 'Image', 'Page', 'Paged Content', 'Publication Issue', and 'Video'. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used. The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies: - Corporate Body - Country - Family - Form - Genre - Geographic Location - Language - Person - Resource Types - Subject Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item content type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies. See 'Entity Reference fields' in the 'Field Types' section below. The vocabularies provided by default are a starting point, and a repository administrator can create whatever vocabularies are desired. Field Types \u00b6 Fields are where Drupal entities store their data. There are different types of fields including boolean, datetime, entity reference, integer, string, text, and text_with_summary. These field types also have widgets (controlling how data is entered) and formatters (controlling how data is displayed). The Drupal 8 documentation on FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters includes a list of the core field types. Modules can provide their own field types, formatters, and widgets. The Controlled Access Terms module provides two additional types for use with Islandora: ETDF, and Typed Relation. These are described below. Entity Reference fields are a special type of field built into Drupal that creates a relationship between two entities. The field's configuration options include which kind of entities can be referenced. The 'Repository Item' content type, provided by islandora_defaults, includes several entity reference fields that reference vocabularies defined by the islandora and controlled_access_terms modules. The 'Member Of' field is an entity reference field, defined by Islandora, which is the Islandora way of imposing a hierarchical order on resource nodes. This can be used to show membership in a collection, for pages that are members of a paged item, and for members of a complex object. EDTF \u00b6 The EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format , which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty. The Default EDTF widget has a validator that only allows strings that conform to the EDTF standard. The Default EDTF formatter allows these date string to be displayed in a variety of human readable ways, including big- or little-endian, and presenting months as numbers, abbreviations, or spelling month names out in full. Nerd note: Big-endian = year, month, day. Little-endian = day, month, year. Middle-endian = month, day, year. When configuring the EDTF widget for a field in a content type, you can choose to allow date intervals, but doing this prevents the widget from accepting values that include times. (The EDTF standard states that date intervals cannot contain times, but the field should be able to accept either a valid EDTF range or a valid EDTF datetime, so this is a bug.) Example of valid inputs in a multi-valued EDTF Date field: Example of the same EDTF dates displayed using little-endian format: Example of a valid EDTF value ('1943-05') and an invalid value ('1943 May') with the corresponding error message: The configuration for the Default EDTF Widget (including options for extra strict date validation, and allowing date intervals and date sets). This configuration can be set per field by clicking the gear icon next to any Default EDTF Widget field at Administration >> Structure >> Content types >> Repository Item >> Manage form display (admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/form-display) Example of how the EDTF formatter settings can change the display of an EDTF value: The EDTF formatter settings can be changed per field by clicking the gear icon next to any Default EDTF formatter field at Administration >> Structure >> Content types >> Repository Item >> Manage display (admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/display). By default, EDTF date values are indexed in Solr as string values. The entered value (not the displayed value) is indexed. Solr note: The Solr string data type requires the full field value to match the query in order to count as a match. This means that searching for 2014 will not retrieve a record where the recorded date value is 2014-11-02 . EDTF date fields may be configured as sort fields in your search results Views. Currently by default, this results in a simple ordering by the literal EDTF date string. An EDTF date field with multiple or unlimited number of allowed values may be set as a sort field. In this case, the first occurrence of the field value is used as the sorting value. Typed Relation \u00b6 A Typed Relation field is an extension of Drupal's Entity Reference field, which allows the user to qualify the relation. It was created for describing a resource's contributors (modelled as taxonomy terms or some other Drupal entities) as well as their roles in this resource node (such as 'author', 'illustrator', or 'architect'). With only Drupal's Entity Reference fields, we would need individual fields for 'author', 'illustrator', 'architect', and any other roles that may need to be made available. Using a Typed Relation field, we can have one field for \"Contributors\" and let the user pick the role from a dropdown list. Nerd note: The parts of a field are called properties, so 'entity reference' and 'relation type' are properties of the Typed Relation field type. Islandora Defaults provides a 'Linked Agent' field as part of the Repository Item content type, and populates the available relationships from the MARC relators list. The list of available relations for this field is configurable at '/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields/node.islandora_object.field_linked_agent'. If you re-use this existing field on another content type, you can define different available relations for that instance of the field. Relations are defined in the format key|value , and the key is used in the RDF mapping (see below). Typed Relation fields and mapping to RDF: Unlike other fields, which can be assigned RDF predicates in RDF Mapping yaml files, a typed relation field uses a different predicate depending on the chosen \"type\". These predicates are assigned using the 'keys' in the key|value configuration. The key must be formated namespace:predicate , e.g. relators:act . The namespace ('relators') must be pre-defined in code, using a hook. See the RDF Mapping section of Create / Update a Content Type for more details, including a list of available pre-defined namespaces. Getting Metadata into Fedora and a Triple-store \u00b6 The above sections described how Drupal manages and stores metadata, but Islandora 8 provides for pushing that metadata into a Fedora 4+ repository and a triple-store. Islandora does this by using Drupal's serialization capabilities to provide a JSON-LD serialization that can be ingested by Fedora 4+ repository and triple-stores. In response to actions taken as a result of if-then configurations in Contexts , Islandora sends notifications to the repository and triple-store that an entity available to ingest. The JSON-LD module (written for Islandora) takes an entity and its corresponding RDF mapping (a structure defined by the contributed RDF module) to create a JSON-LD serialization. An RDF mapping for a content type, media type, or vocabulary lists its fields and the RDF predicates that should be used for them. The JSON-LD serialization for an entity is available by appending ?_format=jsonld to the entity's URL. This particular syntax takes advantage of the REST API module. Below is an example JSONLD document representing the RDF serialization of a Repository item node created in a standard islandora-playbook based vagrant VM: { \"@graph\":[ { \"@id\":\"http://localhost:8000/node/1\", \"@type\":[ \"http://pcdm.org/models#Object\" ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\":[ { \"@value\":\"New York, New York. A large lobster brought in by the New England fishing boat [Fulton Fish Market]\", \"@language\":\"en\" } ], \"http://schema.org/author\":[ { \"@id\":\"http://localhost:8000/user/1\" } ], \"http://schema.org/dateCreated\":[ { \"@value\":\"2019-03-14T19:05:24+00:00\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\" } ], \"http://schema.org/dateModified\":[ { \"@value\":\"2019-03-14T19:20:51+00:00\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\" } ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/date\":[ { \"@value\":\"1943-05\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" }, { \"@value\":\"1943-05\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth\" } ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent\":[ { \"@value\":\"1 negative\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" } ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier\":[ { \"@value\":\"D 630714\", \"@type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" } ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/type\":[ { \"@id\":\"http://localhost:8000/taxonomy/term/11\" } ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights\":[ { \"@value\":\"No known restrictions.

A large lobster brought in by the New England fishing boat [Fulton Fish Market]\", \"@language\":\"en\" } ], Also note that the URI ( @id ) value is 'http://localhost:8000/node/1' (without the ?_format=jsonld ). Old versions of Islandora 8 included the ?_format=jsonld , and dealing with discrepancies is described at \" Adding back ?_format=jsonld \". Batch editing metadata in fields \u00b6 If you are editing multiple resources in order for them to have the same metadata value, the Views Bulk Edit module can help. Here is a video of creating a view using Views Bulk Operations to apply a subject term to multiple resources simultaneously. For more complex changes, or when the values need to differ for each value, an export-modify-reimport method may be needed. Use a view to export CSV or other structured data (including an identifier such as a node id), modify the values as necessary, then use migrate csv or Workbench to re-import and update the values.","title":"Metadata"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#metadata-in-islandora-8","text":"TL;DR: In Islandora 8, metadata is stored in Drupal, in fields attached to entities (nodes or media). This allows us to interact with metadata (add, edit, remove, display, index in a search engine...) almost entirely using standard Drupal processes. If exporting this metadata to Fedora and/or a triplestore, the values are serialized to RDF using mappings that can be set for each bundle. Drupal 8 Terminology In Drupal 8, Fields can be attached to bundles (sometimes called entity sub-types -- e.g. Content types, Media types, Vocabularies) or entities (e.g. Users). For more on Fields, see \"2.3 Content Entities and Fields\" and \"6.3 Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type\" in the Official Drupal Guide. As described in the resource nodes section , Islandora 8 digital objects are comprised of Drupal nodes for descriptive metadata, Drupal media for technical metadata, and Drupal files for the binary objects. This section describes how Islandora 8 uses and extends Drupal fields to manage descriptive metadata.","title":"Metadata in Islandora 8"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#content-types","text":"In Drupal, Nodes come in different sub-types called Content Types (e.g. Article, Basic page, Repository item). Content types contain fields, and configurations for how those fields can be edited or displayed. Each content type is essentially a metadata profile that can be used for a piece of web content, or to describe a digital resource. For each field in a content type, an administrator can configure how data is entered, how it can be displayed, how many values can be stored, and how long the value can be. Some configurations, such as data entry and display, can be changed at any time. Others, such as how long a value can be or what options are available in a select list, cannot be changed once content has been created without first deleting all content of that type. However, fields can be added to existing content types with no consequence. For example, the 'islandora_defaults' module provides a Repository Item content type that defines many fields including \"Alternative Title\" and \"Date Issued\". Under the management menu for Repository Item you can see a list of the fields it includes (\"Manage fields\") as well as tabs for changing the input forms (\"Manage form display\") and display modes (\"Manage display\"). See the \" Create / Update a Content Type \" section for more details on creating and configuring fields. Titles aren't fields. Note that the \"Title\" field does not appear in this list. It is a built-in part of every content type. You can edit the label of this \"field\" if you want it called something other than \"Title\" under the \"Edit\" tab for that content type. This built-in title \"field\" is limited to 255 characters; if your content has longer titles it is encouraged to create a separate long_title field to store the full title and reserve the default title field for a display title. There is a contributed module called Node Title Length , which allows an administrator to configure the length of the title field in the core node table. However, this only works on nodes (not media or other entities) and involves meddling in a core Drupal database schema, which makes some people uneasy. 7.x Migration Note: What about my XML? In 7.x, metadata were usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values. Where some hierarchy or field grouping is necessary, this can be done in Drupal using Paragraphs , a widely-used Drupal contrib module. At the moment (Nov 2019) we are working on the technical challenge of mapping data from paragraphs into RDF in Fedora. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a default mapping ( spreadsheet , guidance document ) which provides a basic, yet customizable, transform between MODS metadata and Drupal fields in Islandora Defaults. It is suggested that individual institutions customize the mapping to meet their unique needs. That said, if keeping the \"legacy\" XML metadata from 7.x is important to you, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity. However, there is no mechanism in Islandora 8 for editing XML in a user-friendly way. When you create a node (i.e. an instantiation of a content type, such as by using Drupal's \"Add Content\" workflow), the fields defined by its content type become available. Once a node is created, its content type cannot be changed. To \"switch\" a node to a different content type, a repository manager would need to create a new node of the target content type, map the field values (programmatically or by copy-paste), and update any Media or children that refer to the old node to refer to the new one. Not all content types in your Drupal site need be Islandora \"resource nodes\". A \"resource node\" content type will likely have behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) associated with it. This configuration, and the communication to the user of which content types are and are not considered to be Islandora resource nodes is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a \"resource node\" is usually considered a descriptive record for \"a thing\", and is conceptually similar to an \"Islandora Object\" in 7.x, i.e. a \"Fedora Object\" in Fedora 3.x and below.","title":"Content Types"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#vocabularies","text":"In Drupal, Taxonomy Vocabularies (or simply Vocabularies ) are also entity sub-types that define a set of fields and their configurations. Whereas instances of content types are called nodes , items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms ). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article content type includes a field field_tags that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary. There are two ways that users can interact with taxonomies: they can be \"closed,\" e.g. a fixed list to pick from in a dropdown, or \"open,\" e.g. field_tags where users can enter new terms, which are created on the fly. This is not set on the vocabulary itself, but in the configuration of the field (typically on a node). Terms within vocabularies have an ordering, and can have hierarchical structure, but do not need to. Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the 'Islandora Models' vocabulary which includes the terms 'Audio', 'Binary', 'Collection', 'Digital Document', 'Image', 'Page', 'Paged Content', 'Publication Issue', and 'Video'. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used. The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies: - Corporate Body - Country - Family - Form - Genre - Geographic Location - Language - Person - Resource Types - Subject Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item content type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies. See 'Entity Reference fields' in the 'Field Types' section below. The vocabularies provided by default are a starting point, and a repository administrator can create whatever vocabularies are desired.","title":"Vocabularies"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#field-types","text":"Fields are where Drupal entities store their data. There are different types of fields including boolean, datetime, entity reference, integer, string, text, and text_with_summary. These field types also have widgets (controlling how data is entered) and formatters (controlling how data is displayed). The Drupal 8 documentation on FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters includes a list of the core field types. Modules can provide their own field types, formatters, and widgets. The Controlled Access Terms module provides two additional types for use with Islandora: ETDF, and Typed Relation. These are described below. Entity Reference fields are a special type of field built into Drupal that creates a relationship between two entities. The field's configuration options include which kind of entities can be referenced. The 'Repository Item' content type, provided by islandora_defaults, includes several entity reference fields that reference vocabularies defined by the islandora and controlled_access_terms modules. The 'Member Of' field is an entity reference field, defined by Islandora, which is the Islandora way of imposing a hierarchical order on resource nodes. This can be used to show membership in a collection, for pages that are members of a paged item, and for members of a complex object.","title":"Field Types"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#edtf","text":"The EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format , which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty. The Default EDTF widget has a validator that only allows strings that conform to the EDTF standard. The Default EDTF formatter allows these date string to be displayed in a variety of human readable ways, including big- or little-endian, and presenting months as numbers, abbreviations, or spelling month names out in full. Nerd note: Big-endian = year, month, day. Little-endian = day, month, year. Middle-endian = month, day, year. When configuring the EDTF widget for a field in a content type, you can choose to allow date intervals, but doing this prevents the widget from accepting values that include times. (The EDTF standard states that date intervals cannot contain times, but the field should be able to accept either a valid EDTF range or a valid EDTF datetime, so this is a bug.) Example of valid inputs in a multi-valued EDTF Date field: Example of the same EDTF dates displayed using little-endian format: Example of a valid EDTF value ('1943-05') and an invalid value ('1943 May') with the corresponding error message: The configuration for the Default EDTF Widget (including options for extra strict date validation, and allowing date intervals and date sets). This configuration can be set per field by clicking the gear icon next to any Default EDTF Widget field at Administration >> Structure >> Content types >> Repository Item >> Manage form display (admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/form-display) Example of how the EDTF formatter settings can change the display of an EDTF value: The EDTF formatter settings can be changed per field by clicking the gear icon next to any Default EDTF formatter field at Administration >> Structure >> Content types >> Repository Item >> Manage display (admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/display). By default, EDTF date values are indexed in Solr as string values. The entered value (not the displayed value) is indexed. Solr note: The Solr string data type requires the full field value to match the query in order to count as a match. This means that searching for 2014 will not retrieve a record where the recorded date value is 2014-11-02 . EDTF date fields may be configured as sort fields in your search results Views. Currently by default, this results in a simple ordering by the literal EDTF date string. An EDTF date field with multiple or unlimited number of allowed values may be set as a sort field. In this case, the first occurrence of the field value is used as the sorting value.","title":"EDTF"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#typed-relation","text":"A Typed Relation field is an extension of Drupal's Entity Reference field, which allows the user to qualify the relation. It was created for describing a resource's contributors (modelled as taxonomy terms or some other Drupal entities) as well as their roles in this resource node (such as 'author', 'illustrator', or 'architect'). With only Drupal's Entity Reference fields, we would need individual fields for 'author', 'illustrator', 'architect', and any other roles that may need to be made available. Using a Typed Relation field, we can have one field for \"Contributors\" and let the user pick the role from a dropdown list. Nerd note: The parts of a field are called properties, so 'entity reference' and 'relation type' are properties of the Typed Relation field type. Islandora Defaults provides a 'Linked Agent' field as part of the Repository Item content type, and populates the available relationships from the MARC relators list. The list of available relations for this field is configurable at '/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields/node.islandora_object.field_linked_agent'. If you re-use this existing field on another content type, you can define different available relations for that instance of the field. Relations are defined in the format key|value , and the key is used in the RDF mapping (see below). Typed Relation fields and mapping to RDF: Unlike other fields, which can be assigned RDF predicates in RDF Mapping yaml files, a typed relation field uses a different predicate depending on the chosen \"type\". These predicates are assigned using the 'keys' in the key|value configuration. The key must be formated namespace:predicate , e.g. relators:act . The namespace ('relators') must be pre-defined in code, using a hook.

Traditional objects become resource nodes \u00b6 The conventional Islandora 7 definition of an object is a file loaded in the repository with associated derivatives. In Islandora 7, objects (video files, audio files, PDFs, etc.) are loaded through the user interface, and Datastreams are generated automatically. These consist of access and display copies, the metadata, OCH/HOCR, technical metadata, and more. All of these Datastreams are directly connected to the object and accessed through the admin interface. In Islandora 8, the traditional Islandora 7 objects (video files, audio files, etc. that were represented in different content models) are now Drupal nodes. Islandora object nodes are a special kind of Drupal node, distinct from nodes that exist for other content types such as a blog post, an article, a page (like the About page on a site), and others.

However, the Datastreams are no longer connected to the original object in the same immutable way. Each of these Datastreams can be manipulated through Drupal by non-developers.

(See the section describing resource node membership .) This involves creating a resource node for the root record (e.g. the book or the photograph) and child resource nodes for each sub-component (e.g. \"Page 1\" and \"Page 2\" or \"recto\" and \"verso\") with their corresponding media. Each \"child\" resource node contains a reference to their \"parent\" resource node using the field_member_of property. Child v. Member Islandora 8 uses the \"child\" and \"member\" descriptor for resource nodes that store a reference to another resource node in the \"Member Of\" field interchangeably. Administrators will more often see the \"member\" terminology more often while front-end users will usually see \"child\" terminology. Similar to the collection view showing members of a collection, Islandora provides an Islandora Model terms, Paged Content and Page , that can be used to trigger paged content behaviors. Islandora Defaults provides a Context for Paged Content resource nodes to trigger displaying an OpenSeadragon viewer showing the child resource nodes' service files. To enable this, use the Paged Content for the Islandora Model of the parent resource node and Page for the Islandora Model of the child resource node. After the child resource nodes have services file Media (either generated via the built-in derivative creation or added manually), they will be included in the OpenSeadragon paginated viewer displayed on the parent resource node's page. (See the IIIF Documentation for more details on controlling the viewer's behavior.) However, repository managers can use any method they like, such as a view-based list of teasers, a gallery, or a slide-show to display child resource nodes. By default child resource nodes are un-ordered. To order the sub-components of a paged content resource node, Islandora provides a Weight field to store a integer value on child resource nodes. Children resource nodes with smaller weight values will come before child resource nodes with larger weight values. This follows the usual ordering pattern of 1 (smaller) coming before 2 (larger). Weight values do not need to be sequential, just ordered from smallest to largest. For example, the first child resource node can have a value of 10 and the next could have a value of 20 and they will be ordered accordingly. Should a new child be added with the weight value of 15 it will automatically be sorted after the child with the weight value 10 and before the child with the weight value 20 . Child resource nodes can be reordered using a drag-and-drop interface by clicking on the Re-order Children button on the Children tab of the parent resource node. Re-ordering children resource nodes on this page and clicking Save will cause each child resource node's weight value to be updated using sequential values. Why not Drupal's book or weight modules? Drupal provides the book module in core for creating multi-level ordered content, such as books and manuals. However, this module stores structure and pagination separately from the nodes making serializing these relationships as RDF we can provide to Fedora more difficult than simply using field_member_of with an RDF mapping. Support for the book module may be added in the future. Drupal also has a weight module that provides a weight field and a drag-and-drop reordering user-interface. However, this module requires users to set a specified range of values which includes their negative corresponding value. E.g. a range setting of '20' will require all children to have a value between '-20' to '20'. This presumes a repository manager can predict how many pages the largest paged content item in their repository will be beforehand. Also, these weight values are serialized into RDF using the Collections Ontology 'index' predicate which assumes positive integer values which cannot be guaranteed using the weight module.","title":"Paged Content"},{"location":"user-documentation/resource-nodes/","text":"Resource Nodes \u00b6 This page describes the Islandora concept of a Resource Node. For a step-by-step demonstration, see the tutorial Create a resource node . A resource node holds the descriptive metadata for an Islandora object, as well as groups together the various files that are part of the object for preservation or display, such as the original file and various derivative files generated from it. The model for exactly what constitutes an object in Islandora 8 is flexible and can be adapted to the needs of specific users. For example, the Islandora Defaults configuration considers an object as a resource node of the type \"Repository Item\" which contains descriptive metadata about the object. Attached to that Node are one or more Media, each representing a file that is part of this object, such as \"Original File\", \"Thumbnail\", \"Preservation Master\", etc. With this model, every original file uploaded into Islandora has its own resource node. Multi-file Media configurations also attach Media to a parent node, but allow for that node to be represened by multiple \"Original File\"s. In this model, a Media contains the original file as well as any derivative files created from it (thumbnail, service file, etc.). For an example of where these two different approaches could apply, the basic configuration might make sense for a book that has rich page-level metadata, so that each page would be its own Node with its own metadata record; the multi-file media configuration might be a better fit for a book that does not have page-level metadata (except an ordering or page numbers), so that each Media would represent one page, and all pages (Media) would be attached to a single parent Node/metadata record for the entire book. As we learned in the introduction , objects in an Islandora repository are represented as a combination of resource nodes, media, and files in Drupal. Because of this, their metadata profile, display, form (and much more) are configurable through the Drupal UI. This gives repository administrators a huge degree of control over their repository without any need for coding. Much more so than ever before. And since we're using a core Drupal solution for modeling our resource nodes and media, compatibility with third-party modules is virtually guaranteed. This opens up a plethora of solutions from the Drupal community that will save you untold time and effort when implementing your repository with Islandora. Properties \u00b6 Resource nodes, as Drupal nodes, have some common basic properties regardless of content type. These properties are not fields. This means that they cannot be removed and have limited configurability. Their name, what type of data they hold, etc... are all baked in. Here's an example of the basic properties on nodes: nid: 1 uid: 1 title: \"I am an Islandora 8 object\" created: 1550703004 changed: 1550703512 uuid: 02932f2c-e4c2-4b7e-95e1-4aceab78c638 type: islandora_object status: 1 As you can see, it's all system data used at the Drupal level to track the basics. Property Value nid The local ID for the node uid The ID of the Drupal user who created the node uuid The global ID for any entity title The title for the node created Timestamp of when the node was created changed Timestamp of when the node was last updated type Content type (e.g. which group of fields are present on the node) status Published, unpublished, etc... Compared to Islandora 7 These node properties are analogous to following Islandora 7.x object properties: Islandora 7 Islandora 8 owner uid dc.title title PID uuid status status The small amount of configurability available for these properties is found on the content type editing form where a user can choose to change the label of the title field, whether or not to display author information on the node's page, etcetera. These settings will only apply to nodes of that particular content type. To view all of a node's property and field values administrators can use the 'Devel' tab's 'Load' section: Fields \u00b6 In addition to the basic node properties identified above, resource nodes (like all Drupal nodes) can have fields. Most of what we would think of as descriptive metadata is stored as fields. Resource nodes use 'content types' to define a specific set of required and optional fields it has; we can think of content types as metadata profiles for our objects. For example, you might have a content type for a set of repository objects that have very specialized metadata requirements but another content type for generic repository objects that share a more general set of metadata fields. A resource node's content type is set on its creation and is immutable. The section on metadata describes in more detail how fields on Islandora objects work. Configuring fields (adding, editing, removing) is usually done through the Manage > Content types interface, as is described in the tutorial, Create/Update a Content Type . Islandora has a notion of a content model , which is used to identify what type of content is being represented by a node (e.g. an image, a video, a collection of other items, etc...). This is done using a special field, Model , which accepts taxonomy terms from the Islandora Models vocabulary. By applying a term from the Islandora Models vocabulary to a node, Islandora will become aware of how to handle the node in response to certain events, like choosing a viewer or generating derivatives. Compared to Islandora 7 Content models in Islandora 7 were immutable and contained restrictions as to what types of datastreams could be associated with an object. Islandora 8 imposes no such restrictions. Content models can be changed at any time, and they in no way dictate what types of media can be associated with a node. Media \u00b6 All resource nodes can be linked to any number of media. The media associated with a resource node can be managed using the \"Media\" tab when viewing a node. Much like the \"Members\" tab, Actions can be performed in bulk using the checkboxes and Actions dropdown. See the media section for more details. Display Modes \u00b6 Drupal uses \"display modes\" (also called \"view modes\") as alternative ways to present content to users. You may be familiar with the \"full\" and \"teaser\" versions of nodes, which are rendered using two corresponding display modes. Islandora makes use of display modes to control how media content is displayed. Islandora Defaults provides two display modes for Media, one which renders the OpenSeadragon viewer and the other which renders the pdf.js viewer. These two display modes can be enabled by using \"Display hints\" in the node edit form, or you can configure Islandora to use a specific display mode for all media based on the file's Mime type. Both methods make use of Contexts . To set the display mode on the resource node's edit form, select the display mode you want to use for that node in the Display hints field: Due to the associated Context configurations (\"Open Seadragon\" and \"PDFjs Viewer\") that are shipped with Islandora Defaults, the selected display mode will then be used when the resource node's page is rendered. At a global level, there are a couple of ways to tell Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer to render the content of the media field whenever the media has a Mime type of application/pdf . The first way is to edit the \"PDFjs Viewer\" Context. By default, this Context tells Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer if the node has the term \"PDFjs\" (yes, that's a taxonomy term): If you add the Condition \"Node has Media with Mime type\" and configure it to use application/pdf as the Mime type, like this: Context will use whichever Condition applies (as long as you don't check \"Require all conditions\"). That is, if the \"PDFjs\" display hint option in the node edit form is checked, or if the node's media has a Mime type of application/pdf , the media content will be rendered using the PDFjs viewer. The second way to use the media's Mime type to render its content with the PDFjs viewer is to create a separate Context that will detect the media's Mime type and use the configured display mode automatically. To do this, create a new Context. Add a \"Node has Media with Mime type\" condition and specify the Mime type, and then add a \"Change View mode\" Reaction that selects the desired display mode: Finally, save your Context. From that point on, whenever the media for a node has the configured Mime type, Drupal will render the media using the corresponding display mode. The node-level and global approaches are not exclusive to one another. One Context can override another depending on the order of execution. Contexts are applied in the order they are displayed on the Contexts page, which is editable through a drag-and-drop interface. Whichever Condition appears last in the list of Contexts between the node-level Condition (which in this case is the \"Node has term\" condition) the global Condition (which is \"Node has Media with Mime type\"), that one will override the other. An example of having the display mode specified in the node edit form intentionally override the display mode based on Mime type is to have media with the image/jp2 mime-type configured to use to use the OpenSeadragon viewer, but to manually select the OpenSeadragon display mode for nodes with JPEG media (for example, a very large JPEG image of a map, where the OpenSeadragon's pan and zoom features would be useful). Members \u00b6 Islandora has a notion of membership , which is used to create a parent/child relationship between two resource nodes. Membership is denoted using another special field, \"Member Of\". The \"Member Of\" field can hold multiple references, so it is possible for a single child to belong to multiple parents, but may also complicate the creation of breadcrumbs. Any two nodes can be related in this way, though typically, the parent node has a content model of Collection or Paged Content (see their respective pages for more details). Compared to Islandora 7 In Islandora 7, there was a distinction between belonging to a collection and belonging to a compound object. In Islandora 8, this distinction is not present, essentially allowing every resource node to be part of a compound object. Child v. Member Islandora 8 uses the \"child\" and \"member\" descriptor for resource nodes that store a reference to another resource node in the \"Member Of\" field interchangeably. Administrators will more often see the \"member\" terminology more often while front-end users will usually see \"child\" terminology. For any node, its Children tab can be used to see all its members. You can also perform Actions in bulk on members using the checkboxes and the Actions dropdown as well as clicking on the Re-order Children tab to adjust the order in which they display.","title":"Resource Nodes"},{"location":"user-documentation/resource-nodes/#resource-nodes","text":"This page describes the Islandora concept of a Resource Node.

An example of having the display mode specified in the node edit form intentionally override the display mode based on Mime type is to have media with the image/jp2 mime-type configured to use to use the OpenSeadragon viewer, but to manually select the OpenSeadragon display mode for nodes with JPEG media (for example, a very large JPEG image of a map, where the OpenSeadragon's pan and zoom features would be useful).","title":"Display Modes"},{"location":"user-documentation/resource-nodes/#members","text":"Islandora has a notion of membership , which is used to create a parent/child relationship between two resource nodes. Membership is denoted using another special field, \"Member Of\". The \"Member Of\" field can hold multiple references, so it is possible for a single child to belong to multiple parents, but may also complicate the creation of breadcrumbs. Any two nodes can be related in this way, though typically, the parent node has a content model of Collection or Paged Content (see their respective pages for more details). Compared to Islandora 7 In Islandora 7, there was a distinction between belonging to a collection and belonging to a compound object. In Islandora 8, this distinction is not present, essentially allowing every resource node to be part of a compound object. Child v. Member Islandora 8 uses the \"child\" and \"member\" descriptor for resource nodes that store a reference to another resource node in the \"Member Of\" field interchangeably. Administrators will more often see the \"member\" terminology more often while front-end users will usually see \"child\" terminology. For any node, its Children tab can be used to see all its members. You can also perform Actions in bulk on members using the checkboxes and the Actions dropdown as well as clicking on the Re-order Children tab to adjust the order in which they display.","title":"Members"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/","text":"Setup and Configure Search \u00b6 Islandora 8 comes with the Drupal 8 Search API and SOLR modules enabled with a corresponding SOLR instance. This guide gives an overview to the setup provided by the islandora-playbook. Much more detail is available in the Search API documentation . Another helpful resource is Adam Fuch's \"Drupal 8 Custom Site Search with Search API\" (https://www.electriccitizen.com, 2018-01-10; last accessed 2019-03-08). Indexing Islandora 8 with SOLR \u00b6 To access the search indexing settings, log in as an administrator and navigate to '/admin/config/search/search-api' or click Configuration and then Search API . SOLR Server Configuration \u00b6 On the Search API page, Use the Solr Server link to view the SOLR server's configuration and the Default Solr content index link to view or update the index settings. In most cases, where the site was built using Ansible, the Solr Server settings that were configured during installation should be left alone. SOLR Index Configuration \u00b6 The Default Solr content index user interface is divided into four tabs: View , Edit , Fields , and Processors . View Tab \u00b6 The 'View' tab gives an overview of the index and its status: Index status is a progress bar that indicates how many items have been indexed. Status allows you to enable/disable the index from being used. Datasource indicates what types of entities are being indexed and how many have. Tracker states which item tracker is being used. Server provides a link to the SOLR server's configuration page. Server index status is a count of the total number of items returned from an unfiltered empty search. Generally speaking, this should match the total number of items indexed. See the Drupal 8 Search API FAQ for more details. Cron batch size displays how many items will be indexed when Drupal's cron runs. The View tab also provides links to some common actions. Start Indexing Now allows you to start a indexing job for a specified number of items (default is 'all'). You can also specify how many items should be indexed in each batch (default is '50'). The other links allow a repository manager to queue all objects for reindexing, clear the index, or rebuild tracking information. Edit Tab \u00b6 The Edit tab allows repository managers to configure how the index works as a whole, including the Index name, the data sources \u2014 entity types \u2014 it can index (including which specific content types or taxonomies will be indexed), which server it is connected to, and other SOLR-specific options. Content (types) is the only data source enabled by default. Selecting Taxonomy term will enable searching taxonomies which is recommended if the repository uses taxonomies for subjects or other discovery points. Once the data sources are enabled a configuration box for each of them will appear in a section just below the list of data sources. This allows repository managers to select which content types (or taxonomy vocabularies) will be included in the index. By default all the content types, and vocabularies if the taxonomy data source is enabled, are indexed. Defaults The defaults assume a repository is adding content using the web interface. If a repository manager plans on bulk-loading content they should disable the Index items immediately option in the expandable Index Options box and increase the 'Cron batch size' option. Fields Tab \u00b6 The Fields tab allows repository managers to select which fields will be indexed. The default set of fields enabled come from a standard Drupal installation and do not reflect the fields Islandora adds for 'Repository Item'. Repository managers need to add the fields necessary for their Islandora instance. To add a field, click the + Add fields button. A shadow-box will appear with a list of the fields available for the index. Some fields, such as the Body ('body') field provided by Drupal, have multiple properties which can be completely different values or variations on the same value. Click on the plus-sign next to the field to show the properties available to index. In most cases repository managers can ignore the properties list and click the Add button by the field to index the default property ('value'). Only select a different field property if you understand how it will impact user searching. Entity reference fields, such as Tags ('field_tags'), allow you to select fields or their properties from the referenced entity for indexing, such as a referenced taxonomy term's name field. Once the fields are added they can be configured further on the Fields tab, although the label, machine name, and type usually don't need to be changed. The 'Type' dropdown has several different Full-text processing options available, which may be of interest. Each is described in the expandable Data Types box at the bottom of the page. The Boost setting allows repository managers to increase the weight of particular fields when calculating search relevancy. Processors Tab \u00b6 The Processors tab allows repository managers to adjust how data and search queries are processed to adjust results. The defaults are acceptable in most cases. Searching Islandora 8 \u00b6 The Search API SOLR module comes with a search page pre-configured (accessible at '/solr-search/content'). To edit the search page, navigate to '/admin/structure/views/view/solr_search_content'. Repository managers may want to change the URL used to access the page, add it to the site navigation, or add a search box. In the 'Page Settings' box in the middle of the page, click on the existing path to open a shadow-box with an edit field. Change the URL as desired, for example, to 'search' and click Apply . Then, click the No menu link just below it to open the menu settings shadow-box. Selecting 'Normal menu entry' will allow a repository manager to add a menu link text, description, and place it within the site menu tree (the default, <Main navigation> works for most sites). A search box can be added by expanding the Advanced options and changing the Exposed form in block setting and then use the Block Layout interface (found at '/admin/structure/block') to place the block where desired. After making changes to the View's settings, click the Save button to ensure the changes are not lost. Islandora's Repository Items are displayed in the search results as a fully rendered entity by default. Repository managers can choose which view mode should be used for each search datasource by clicking the Settings link next to the Show: setting under the Format section of the search view configuration page (shown in a red box in the screenshot below). The Teaser and Search result highlighting input are the two most likely options. Alternatively, repository managers can select specific fields to display instead by clicking the Rendered Entity link and changing it to Fields and then choosing which fields will be displayed in the Fields section underneath. Thumbnails thumbnails will not immediately be available using the Fields display option without more advanced configurations.","title":"Configure Search"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#setup-and-configure-search","text":"Islandora 8 comes with the Drupal 8 Search API and SOLR modules enabled with a corresponding SOLR instance.

It will go in depth on how Islandora allows you to use the various features of Drupal to construct and display repository items. Islandora, like Drupal, provides tools to create a site, but does not force you to conform to any specific site structure, organization, or navigation. There is a hope that we can provide something useful out of the box, while also allowing the full suite of Drupal configuration options. This out-of-the-box configuration is the Islandora Demo module. It is recommended to be familiar with the basics of Drupal, including content types, fields, users, and views. The Official Drupal 8 User Guide and the Community Guide to Drupal 8 are a good place to start. Object Modeling \u00b6 In Islandora, when we say object , we mean a collection of properties describing something. And when we say datastream , we mean a file that is a digital representation of an object. Content in our repositories is stored as an object that is associated with any number of datastreams. In Drupal terms, that makes everything an entity , where An object is a node (a.k.a. content ). Nodes have properties that can be configured called fields . Fields for nodes are grouped together as content types . Datastreams are media , which are files that can have their own fields and media types . Metadata used to categorize entities are taxonomy terms , which also have their own fields and vocabularies . They can represent everything from simple labels to more complex concepts such as people, places, and subjects. Fedora \u00b6 Islandora 7.x basically inherits its object model from Fedora 3.x. In 7.x, Fedora stores all properties and content associated with an object - not only its owner, dc.title, status, PID, and status, but also any content files such as OBJ, DC, MODS, and RELS-EXT. In Islandora 7.x, Fedora is the authoritative, primary source for all aspects of an object. Fedora 3.x is not an optional component of an Islandora 7.x repository, it is the primary datastore. In Islandora 8, using Fedora is optional. That's right, optional. Drupal, and not Fedora, is the primary source of all aspects of an Islandora 8 object, and, with some variations, Drupal, not Fedora, is the primary datastore in an Islandora repository. If Fedora is present in an Islandora 8 repository, content in it is a tightly synchronized copy of object properties and files managed by Drupal. Even though Fedora is optional in Islandora 8, most repositories will use it since it provides its own set of services that are worth taking advantage of, such as: flexible, and configurable, disk storage architecture fixity digest generation Memento versioning integration with RDF/Linked Data triplestores Integration with Microservices via API-X WebAC Policies for access control (not currently leveraged by default) In Islandora repositories that use Fedora, all properties about Drupal nodes are mirrored in Fedora as RDF properties. But, even if an Islandora instance does not use Fedora, Drupal can provide an object's properties as RDF (again, Drupal is the primary source of data in Islandora 8). In addition, the Drupal media associated with Islandora 8 objects are persisted to Fedora, although exactly which media is configurable within the Islandora 8 admin interface. Just as Drupal out of the box has a public and private filesystem, Islandora adds a third filesystem to Drupal called, not surprisingly, \"fedora\", and it is to this filesystem that media are persisted. We will provide more information about Fedora's role in an Islandora 8 repository in the metadata and media sections. Architecture \u00b6 Conceptual Diagram \u00b6 Many users of Islandora may be familiar with the metaphorical diagram of Islandora 7 as a cheeseburger, which provides a memorable approximation of how the different parts of the software stack interact in a vertically-integrated, relatively customizable fashion (ie, Drupal, Solr, Islandora, and Fedora are stable layers, and the \"toppings\" stand in for Solution Packs and other utilities that can be added or removed to customize Islandora): For a similar conceptual approach to Islandora 8, we present it as a bento box: a very modular platform, in which each piece may be removed and replaced with something different, without disrupting other parts of the stack: For a true diagram of how the various parts of Islandora 8 interact, please see the full Architecture Diagram","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user-documentation/user-intro/#object-modeling","text":"In Islandora, when we say object , we mean a collection of properties describing something.
